# FOAF Foundation Overview

The **FOAF Foundation** is a decentralized platform empowering communities to trade goods and services without fiat currency, starting with the **Growoperative app** for gardening surplus and scaling to a **FOAF marketplace** for broader trade. Using a dual-token system (**FOAF** for governance, **RHEO** for transactions), we foster sustainable food systems, reduce waste, and build resilient local economies. Our mission begins in Crawford Bay, British Columbia, with alpha testing in May 2026, and invites global communities to join a movement for real food and disruptive trade.

## Mission
- **Reduce Food Waste**: Enable gardeners to trade surplus (e.g., tomatoes), addressing the $1,600/year household waste problem (Pitch Deck Page 6).
- **Eliminate Fiat Dependence**: Facilitate cash-free trade with mutual credit and RHEO, a depegged currency.
- **Sustain Communities**: Use a 3% RHEO transaction fee to reward maintainers, ending volunteer burnout.
- **Scale Resilience**: Start locally in the Kootenays and inspire global networks through the FOAF marketplace.

## Structure
- **FOAF Foundation**: Oversees the token system (FOAF/RHEO), governance, and ecosystem growth, governed by a DAO by Q4 2023–2024.
- **Growoperative App**: A progressive web app (PWA) piloting mutual credit trading in Crawford Bay, expanding to Kaslo, Nelson, and Winlaw.
- **FOAF Marketplace (Future)**: A platform for trading diverse goods/services (e.g., tools, childcare), launching Q4 2024.
- **Community Networks**: Engages resilience groups via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook to bootstrap adoption.

## Current Status
- **Growoperative App**: Built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and React.js, the PWA supports listing, requesting, matching, and fulfilling trades.
- **Development Needs**: Payment and mutual credit tracking to be added by Q4 2025, with native iOS/Android apps planned for Q2 2026.
- **Funding Goal**: Seeking $300K to complete the MVP and develop apps, enabling alpha testing in May 2026 (Pitch Deck Page 13).
- **Community Pilot**: Targeting Crawford Bay’s resilience groups, with outreach to Kaslo, Nelson, and Winlaw for 2026 gardening season.
