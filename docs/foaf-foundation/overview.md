# FOAF Documentation

What if every gardener’s surplus—every unpicked tomato, every extra zucchini—became the currency of thriving communities? What if local trade, powered by technology and trust, could reshape economies from the ground up? The **FOAF Foundation** is turning this vision into reality with the **Growoperative app**, starting in Crawford Bay, British Columbia, and scaling toward a global **FOAF marketplace**. Fueled by a dual-token system (**FOAF** for governance, **RHEO** for trade), we’re not just building a platform—we’re igniting a movement for real food, resilient networks, and unstoppable innovation.

This repository, `foaf-docs`, is your window into that movement. It’s a living blueprint for a decentralized future, blending practical guides, technical depth, and a bold call to action. Whether you’re a gardener trading basil, a developer coding the next feature, or a visionary ready to invest, here’s where you’ll see how we’re rewriting the rules of sustainability and scale.

## Our Vision: From Waste to Wealth
- **Reclaiming the Lost Harvest**: Canadian households waste $1,600 in food annually—31% of what they buy (Pitch Deck Page 6). In Crawford Bay, we’re piloting a system to trade surplus (e.g., 5 lbs of tomatoes for 2 lbs of carrots), cutting waste and building abundance. Now imagine this in every backyard worldwide.
- **Cash-Free Resilience**: With **RHEO**, a depegged utility token, neighbors trade without dollars, starting with Kootenay resilience groups on Signal and Telegram. It’s mutual credit reborn—accessible, scalable, and free from centralized control.
- **Sustainability That Pays**: A 3% RHEO fee on every trade (e.g., 0.06 RHEO on a 2 RHEO tomato swap) funds the network—50% to node operators, 30% to the treasury, 20% burned. Unlike traditional LETS, which collapsed under volunteer burnout, this self-sustaining model thrives as it grows.
- **A Global Blueprint**: From a progressive web app (PWA) to native iOS/Android apps and a DAO-governed marketplace, we’re crafting a system that scales from rural gardens to urban hubs, all while dodging regulatory overreach with a community-first ethos.

## Where We Stand
- **Growoperative Today**: Our PWA, built on Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and React.js, lets users list surplus, match trades, and track fulfillment. It’s live but lean—payment and credit tracking are still in progress.
- **Roadmap Ahead**:
  - **Q4 2025**: Integrate payment systems and mutual credit, making trades seamless.
  - **Q2 2026**: Launch native apps for iOS and Android, timed for Crawford Bay’s May 2026 alpha test—peak gardening season.
- **The $300K Bridge**: We need $300K to finish the PWA, build native apps, and expand outreach to Kaslo, Nelson, and Winlaw (Pitch Deck Page 13). This isn’t just funding—it’s fuel for a food system revolution.
- **Grassroots Momentum**: We’re already engaging Kootenay resilience networks on Facebook and beyond. Crawford Bay is our lab; the world is our canvas.

## What Makes FOAF Different
- **Dual-Token Engine**:
  - **FOAF**: 25M fixed tokens (8M for airdrops) empower governance and staking. Think of it as a vote for the future, held by pioneers like Crawford Bay’s gardeners.
  - **RHEO**: A fluid, community-priced token for trades (e.g., 2 RHEO for a jar of pickles). No crypto wallet? No barrier—trust networks make it inclusive.
- **Economic Alchemy**: The 3% fee isn’t a tax—it’s a cycle of value, sustaining operators and the DAO while pruning excess RHEO. It’s decentralized economics, refined.
- **DAO at the Core**: By Q4 2024, the community calls the shots—fees, features, expansion. This isn’t a startup; it’s a self-governing ecosystem.
- **Built for All**: No gatekeepers, no jargon. RHEO flows where trust does, from rural co-ops to city collectives.
