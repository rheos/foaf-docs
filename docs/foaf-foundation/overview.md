# FOAF Foundation

## Overview

The **FOAF Foundation** (Friend of a Friend) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a mission to rebuild local economic resilience. We are doing this by developing systems for mutual credit, trust-based value exchange, and peer-to-peer cooperation that can reduce dependence on fiat currency.

We believe people and communities can support each other directly, without always needing banks, cash, or centralized platforms. Our tools are designed to work in the real world, starting with simple local trade and expanding into a full ecosystem for community exchange.

## Our Mission

- **Replace Fiat Dependence**  
  Make it possible for people to meet everyday needs through mutual credit and reputation-based trust, not just money.

- **Strengthen Local Economies**  
  Help communities grow their capacity to support one another through trade, shared resources, and social connection.

- **Govern Together**  
  Operate as a DAO where decisions are made collectively and transparently by those who participate and contribute.

## Why FOAF?

This is not just a crypto project. It is an effort to build economic systems that actually work for people. We are taking ideas from earlier projects that pointed in the right direction but struggled to find traction, and applying them in a way that is simple, grounded, and adaptable to how people already live and interact.

- **Rooted in Trust**  
  The network uses friend-of-a-friend connections to route credit and access. People trade within social trust paths, which reduces friction and builds accountability.

- **Accessible by Design**  
  Anyone can participate. You do not need to buy tokens or understand crypto. The system flows RHEO tokens behind the scenes through trust chains, making it possible to join and trade without holding any assets.

- **Scales with the Community**  
  We are starting with garden surplus, but the model can grow to include everything from tools and repairs to labor and childcare. FOAF is designed to support whatever your community values and wants to exchange.

## Our First Project: GrowOperative

Our first application is called **GrowOperative**. It allows people to share homegrown food and other goods within their social circles. It is simple and local, but it is also a gateway to something bigger. GrowOperative gives people a way to experience mutual credit in action, and to build the trust links that will support broader community trade in the future.
