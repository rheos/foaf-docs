# FOAF Foundation

## Overview

The **FOAF Foundation** (Friend of a Friend) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with a mission to rebuild local economic resilience. We are doing this by developing systems for mutual credit, trust-based value exchange, and peer-to-peer cooperation that reduce dependence on fiat currency.

We believe people and communities can support each other directly, without always needing banks, cash, or centralized platforms. Our tools are designed to work in the real world, starting with simple local trade and growing into a larger ecosystem for community exchange.

## Our Mission

- **Replace Fiat Dependence**  
  Make it possible for people to meet everyday needs through mutual credit and trust rather than money.

- **Strengthen Local Economies**  
  Help communities increase their capacity to support one another through trade, shared resources, and personal connection.

- **Govern Together**  
  Operate as a DAO where decisions are made collectively by those who participate and contribute.

## Why FOAF?

This is not just a crypto experiment. It is an attempt to build economic systems that work for real people in real communities. We are building on earlier ideas that pointed in the right direction but struggled to gain traction. FOAF applies those concepts in a way that is grounded, human-centered, and adaptable to everyday life.

- **Rooted in Trust**  
  The network uses friend-of-a-friend connections to route credit and access. People exchange through social trust paths, which increases accountability and creates space for cooperation.

- **Accessible by Design**  
  Anyone can participate. You do not need to hold tokens or understand crypto. RHEO flows through trust paths in the background, allowing users to contribute and trade without any technical barrier.

- **Grows with the Community**  
  We are starting with food surplus and garden exchange. But this framework can grow to support tools, services, childcare, repairs, and more. FOAF adapts to what each community values and wants to share.

We support what people already know how to do: grow food, help neighbors, and trade what they have. FOAF gives them a simple structure to do more of it, and to do it with trust and resilience in mind.

## Our First Project: GrowOperative

Our first application is called **GrowOperative**. It helps people share homegrown food and other goods within their social circles. It is simple and local, but it is also a gateway to something much larger. GrowOperative gives people a way to experience mutual credit in action, and to build the trust connections that will support broader economic participation over time.

## Our Documents

The project is organized so that contributors and readers can find what they need based on interest and role:

- **FOAF Foundation** â€“ This document: our mission, governance, and overall vision
- **GrowOperative** â€“ First application of our mutual credit and trust system
- **Marketplace and Technical** â€“ Architectural details, token design, and development plans

## Get Involved

We welcome participation from anyone who believes in this mission:

- Gardeners and growers with something to share
- Developers and designers building for impact
- Local organizers strengthening community networks
- People who want to reduce reliance on cash and bring their economy closer to home

We believe in giving communities the tools to care for themselves. This is not a platform to manage them. It is infrastructure that allows neighbors to create value together, build trust, and support the systems they already rely on.

> FOAF is not just a DAO. It is an approach to economic life built on relationships, collaboration, and shared purpose.

Letâ€™s grow something better, together.
