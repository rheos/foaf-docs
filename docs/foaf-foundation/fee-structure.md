# FOAF Foundation Fee Structure

The **FOAF Foundation** sustains its decentralized trading ecosystem, including the **Growoperative app** and future **FOAF marketplace**, through a transparent fee structure using **RHEO**, the utility token. Fees support node operators, fund operations, and stabilize the token supply, ensuring community resilience without volunteer burnout. This document details fees for the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations, aligning with per-unit pricing in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD per lb) and flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit, or RHEO if accepted).

## Fee Types
- **Transaction Fee**: 3% of trade value in RHEO (e.g., 0.12 RHEO on a $4 CAD trade, if RHEO used).
- **Action Fees**:
  - Listing an item: 0.25 RHEO.
  - Claiming a trade: 0.5 RHEO.
  - Settling mutual credit: 1 RHEO.
  - Multi-hop trades (via trust network): +0.1 RHEO per hop.

## Fee Distribution
- **Node Operators**: 50% (incentivizes infrastructure maintenance).
- **Treasury**: 30% (funds development, explainer videos, marketing).
- **Burned**: 20% (controls RHEO supply, maintaining value stability).

## How Fees Work
- **Pricing Context**: Items are listed per unit in local fiat (e.g., $2 CAD per lb for tomatoes). Trades settle in cash, mutual credit (recorded as fiat IOUs, e.g., “$4 CAD owed”), or RHEO (if accepted as a cash substitute).
- **Fee Application**: RHEO fees apply when RHEO is used for settlement or earned via trades. Cash-only settlements incur no transaction fee, but action fees (e.g., listing) still apply.
- **Trust Network**: Contacts-only listings may involve markups by intermediaries (e.g., $2.50 CAD per lb vs. $2 CAD), with fees calculated on the final trade value.

## Example
- **Trade**: Bob lists tomatoes at $2 CAD per lb, 5 lbs available. Paul, via Peter, requests 1 lb at $2.50 CAD (Peter’s markup).
- **Fees**:
  - Bob pays 0.25 RHEO to list.
  - Paul pays 0.5 RHEO to claim.
  - If settled in RHEO, Peter pays 0.075 RHEO (3% on $2.50); Bob’s fee depends on his settlement.
  - If Peter settles credit with Bob, 1 RHEO fee applies, plus 0.1 RHEO for the hop.
- **Outcome**: Fees sustain the system, with 50% to nodes, 30% to treasury, 20% burned.

## Why It’s Sustainable
- **No Burnout**: Fees compensate maintainers, unlike traditional LETS.
- **Accessible**: Users without RHEO earn tokens via trades or airdrops (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
- **Scalable**: Supports multi-location launches, with explainer videos easing adoption.
- **Stable**: Burns prevent RHEO oversupply, supporting community-driven value.
