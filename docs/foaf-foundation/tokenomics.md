# FOAF Foundation Tokenomics

The **FOAF Foundation** supports local trade and community resilience through a dual-token system designed for real-world utility, not speculation.

We use two tokens:
- **FOAF** – fixed-supply governance and staking token
- **RHEO** – flexible-use utility token for transaction fees and optional settlement

This document outlines how both support the GrowOperative app and broader FOAF marketplace — launching with a multi-location rollout beginning in **Crawford Bay, BC (May 2026)**.

## 🌱 How It Works

GrowOperative helps people trade food, goods, and services — with or without cash. Listings are priced in local currency (e.g., $2 CAD per pound of tomatoes), and trades can settle in:

- **Cash** – paid at pickup
- **Mutual Credit** – ledger-based IOUs recorded in fiat value
- **RHEO** – used optionally to settle credit, pay fees, or transfer value

> Users don’t need to pre-own tokens — RHEO can be earned through participation or passed through social trust chains.

## 🔁 Token Overview

### FOAF Token
- **Purpose**: Governance and staking
- **Supply**: 25,000,000 (indivisible, fixed)
- **Use**:
  - Vote on fee structures, rules, and feature changes
  - Stake to earn RHEO rewards
  - Align long-term participation and DAO control

### RHEO Token
- **Purpose**: Utility token for all platform fees and optional trade settlement
- **Supply**: Dynamic, generated through staking and usage
- **Valuation**: Market-driven (non-pegged). For illustration, early onboarding targets 1 RHEO ≈ $1 CAD
- **Use**:
  - Pay fees (transaction, listing, credit settlement)
  - Settle trades (if parties agree)
  - Flow through contact chains as local cash replacement

## 💸 Fee System (RHEO-Based)

All fees are paid in RHEO. These support platform sustainability and reward contributors.

### Core Fees

| Action              | Fee (RHEO)             | Notes                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Transaction         | **3% of trade value**   | Paid by buyer or deducted from trade   |
| Listing             | 0.25                   | Per listing posted                     |
| Claiming a trade    | 0.5                    | Optional action fee                    |
| Credit settlement   | 1.0                    | For formal ledger entries              |

> As the value of RHEO increases, fewer RHEO are required per transaction. The fee system is **value-based**, not fixed in token quantity.

### ⚙️ Updated Multi-Hop Fee: 3% of Markup

When a trade passes through multiple people (e.g., Bob → Peter → Paul), each intermediary pays a routing fee based on the **value they add**.

> **Routing Fee = 3% of your markup (in RHEO)**

#### Example:
- Bob sells tomatoes to Peter at $2.00/lb  
- Peter sells to Paul at $2.50/lb  
- Peter’s markup = $0.50  
- Routing fee = **3% of $0.50 = 0.015 RHEO**

This model:
- Scales fairly across high and low margin trades
- Makes multi-hop trades sustainable and cooperative
- Reflects real value transfer without punishing microtransactions

---

## 🧮 Example Trade Flow

1. **Bob** lists 5 lbs tomatoes at $2.00/lb, contacts-only.
2. **Peter** (his contact) buys 2 lbs to resell.
3. **Paul** (Peter’s contact) buys 1 lb at $2.50.
4. **Peter** earns a $0.50 markup, pays 0.015 RHEO routing fee.
5. **Bob** may pay 0.12 RHEO (3% of $4.00 trade) if RHEO is used.

Each participant pays a **proportional** fee based on their role and earnings.

## 🔐 Why This Works

- **Proportional and Fair**:
