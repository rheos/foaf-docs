# FOAF Foundation Tokenomics

The **FOAF Foundation** supports local trade and community resilience through a dual-token system designed for real-world utility, not speculation.

We use two tokens:
- **FOAF** ‚Äì a fixed-supply governance and staking token
- **RHEO** ‚Äì a flexible-use utility token for transaction fees and trust-based trade settlement

This document outlines how both tokens support the GrowOperative app and broader FOAF marketplace ‚Äî launching with a multi-location rollout beginning in **Crawford Bay, BC (May 2026)**.

## üå± How It Works

GrowOperative helps people trade food, goods, and services ‚Äî with or without cash. Listings are priced in local currency (e.g., $2 CAD per pound of tomatoes), and trades can settle in:

- **Cash (broadly defined)** ‚Äì via eTransfer, PayPal, Venmo, or in-person
- **Mutual Credit** ‚Äì ledger-based IOUs recorded in fiat value
- **RHEO** ‚Äì used for fees and optional value transfer

> Users do not need to hold RHEO directly. Required fees flow through social trust chains, ultimately originating from FOAF holders who stake to generate RHEO. Each intermediary earns a small premium. This makes participation seamless and compensates liquidity providers.

## üí∏ Fees and RHEO Circulation

### Trade-Related Fees (in RHEO)
- **Transaction Fee**: 3% of total trade value (paid by the seller or profit-maker)
- **Multi-Hop Routing Fee**: 3% of intermediary markup
- **RHEO Routing Premium**: 1% of RHEO passed per hop

### Fee Routing Logic
- Fees flow transparently through social trust chains
- Each intermediary earns a 1% routing premium
- The originating FOAF holder receives full RHEO value
- The last party (end-user) accrues small, fair obligations across the chain

---

## üîê Why It Works

- **Accessible**: No crypto experience required; fiat pricing and peer-based flow make it usable by anyone
- **Fair & Scalable**: Fees match value created, not flat rates
- **Sustainable**: Network rewards stakers and contributors
- **Decentralized**: FOAF staking anchors the system; RHEO circulates on demand

## üõ† Road Ahead

- **Airdrop Campaigns**: Distribute 8M FOAF in phases starting May 2026
- **Explainer Videos**: Onboard users through accessible education
- **Seed Round**: Raise $300K to finalize app, support launch, and scale
