# FOAF Foundation Tokenomics

The **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), powers a decentralized trading ecosystem with a dual-token system: **FOAF** for governance and staking, and **RHEO** for transactions and fees. This document outlines the tokenomics supporting the **Growoperative app** and the future **FOAF marketplace**, fostering community resilience and fiat independence. Designed for multi-location launches starting with the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, the system encourages gardeners to expand their gardens by providing a reliable market for surplus, with pricing in local fiat currency and flexible trade settlements.

## Token Overview
- **FOAF**:
  - **Purpose**: Governance and staking token to control the DAO and incentivize long-term participation.
  - **Supply**: Fixed at 25M tokens, indivisible.
  - **Role**: Holders stake FOAF to vote on proposals (e.g., fee adjustments) and earn RHEO rewards.
- **RHEO**:
  - **Purpose**: Utility token for transaction fees and optional trade settlements.
  - **Supply**: Dynamic, depegged from fiat, with community-driven value (initially 1 RHEO ≈ $1 CAD in 2026).
  - **Role**: Pays fees (e.g., 3% transaction fee) and serves as a cash substitute for mutual credit settlements, if agreed.

## Token Distribution
- **FOAF Allocation** (25M total):
  - **Airdrops**: 8M (32%) to gardeners and resilience groups, starting with Crawford Bay and expanding globally (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
  - **Treasury**: 7M (28%) for development, marketing (e.g., explainer videos), and operations.
  - **Team and Advisors**: 5M (20%), vested over 3 years.
  - **Node Operators**: 3M (12%) to incentivize infrastructure maintenance.
  - **Reserve**: 2M (8%) for future initiatives.
- **RHEO Generation**:
  - Generated via staking FOAF or earning through trades.
  - Burned (20% of fees) to control supply and maintain value stability.

## Pricing and Settlement in Growoperative
- **Local Fiat Pricing**: Items are listed with per-unit prices in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD per lb for tomatoes), with quantities specified (e.g., 5 lbs).
- **Settlement Options**:
  - **Cash**: Pay the fiat total based on quantity (e.g., $4 CAD for 2 lbs).
  - **Mutual Credit**: Recorded as IOUs in local fiat (e.g., “Paul owes Peter $2.50 CAD”), settled later with cash, RHEO (if accepted), or goods/services.
  - **RHEO**: Optional cash substitute for credit settlements, valued at community rates.
- **Item Visibility**: Listings can be global or contacts-only, propagating through a friend-of-a-friend network with potential markups by intermediaries (e.g., Peter charges $2.50 CAD per lb vs. Bob’s $2 CAD).

## Fee Structure
- **Transaction Fee**: 3% of trade value in RHEO (e.g., 0.12 RHEO on a $4 CAD trade, if RHEO used).
- **Action Fees**:
  - Listing: 0.25 RHEO.
  - Claiming a trade: 0.5 RHEO.
  - Credit settlement: 1 RHEO.
  - Multi-hop trades: +0.1 RHEO per hop.
- **Fee Distribution**:
  - 50% to node operators (incentivizing infrastructure).
  - 30% to treasury (funding development, explainer videos, etc.).
  - 20% burned (controlling RHEO supply).
- **No Tokens Required**: Users without RHEO can earn them via trades or airdrops, ensuring accessibility.

## Example Trade
- **Bob Lists**: Tomatoes at $2 CAD per lb, 5 lbs, contacts-only.
- **Peter (Bob’s Contact)**: Requests 1 lb ($2 CAD).
- **Paul (Peter’s Contact)**: Requests 1 lb at Peter’s price of $2.50 CAD.
- **Trade**:
  - Peter collects 2 lbs from Bob ($4 CAD, mutual credit).
  - Peter delivers 1 lb to Paul ($2.50 CAD credit).
  - Bob owes 0.12 RHEO (3% fee on $4) if RHEO used; Peter owes 0.075 RHEO (3% on $2.50).
- **Outcome**: Bob earns credit, Peter profits from markup, Paul gets tomatoes.

## Why This Works
- **Incentivizes Growth**: Encourages gardeners to expand production with a reliable market, reducing waste.
- **Accessible**: Local fiat pricing and flexible settlements lower barriers for non-crypto users.
- **Scalable**: Supports multi-location launches, from Crawford Bay to global resilience networks, with explainer videos easing adoption.
- **Sustainable**: Fees fund operations, eliminating volunteer burnout, while burns stabilize RHEO.
- **Decentralized**: DAO governance ensures community control, launching Q4 2023–2024.

## Next Steps
- **Airdrops**: Distribute 8M FOAF to gardeners and resilience groups for the May 2026 alpha (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
- **Explainer Videos**: Launch marketing and instructional videos to onboard users across locations.
- **Funding**: Secure $300K to complete PWA, develop native apps, and scale outreach (see [pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)).
