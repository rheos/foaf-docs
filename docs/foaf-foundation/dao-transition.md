# FOAF Foundation DAO Transition

The **FOAF Foundation** is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed to empower communities through decentralized trading ‚Äî starting with the **GrowOperative app** and scaling to the full **FOAF marketplace**. This document outlines the transition to DAO governance, giving community members control over system rules, fee structures, token distribution, and development priorities.

---

## üõ† Transition Plan

- **Current State (2025)**  
  The FOAF Foundation is stewarded by a founding team (see [team in pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)) managing the GrowOperative PWA and initial token distribution.

- **Q3‚ÄìQ4 2025**  
  A phased shift to DAO governance with key milestones:
  - **Smart Contract Deployment** ‚Äì FOAF staking and on-chain proposal/voting contracts
  - **Community Onboarding** ‚Äì Airdrop of 8M FOAF (32% of supply) to gardeners and resilience communities (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md))
  - **Pilot Governance** ‚Äì Test DAO participation in select communities ahead of alpha

- **Q2‚ÄìQ3 2026**  
  DAO governance pilots launched during the **May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay**, extended to other early-adopting communities

- **Q4 2026 onward**  
  Full DAO governance of all platform parameters and treasury functions

## üß† Governance Mechanics

- **FOAF Tokens**  
  - Fixed supply: 25M indivisible tokens  
  - Used for staking and governance  
  - 1 FOAF = 1 vote, optionally weighted by stake duration or reputation

- **Proposal System**  
  - Any FOAF holder can propose changes (e.g., adjusting transaction fees, expanding RHEO routing premium)
  - Minimum stake required to submit

- **Voting Rules**  
  - Quorum: 10% of all staked FOAF  
  - Approval: Simple majority or configurable threshold  
  - Participation: Pseudonymous via wallet addresses; identity optional

- **Execution**  
  - Treasury-managed proposals implemented via smart contracts or delegated contributors  
  - Funded by 30% of all RHEO-based system fees

---

## ‚öô Key Decisions Managed by the DAO

- **Fee Adjustments**
  - Modify core RHEO-based fees (e.g., transaction fee, routing markup, routing premium)
  - Toggle listing fees or action fees (if ever enabled)

- **RHEO Routing Premiums**
  - Adjust the % premium earned by intermediaries who forward RHEO across the trust graph (default = 1% per hop)

- **Development Priorities**
  - Allocate treasury funds for milestones (e.g., $300K for native apps, explainer videos, or node tools)

- **Airdrop Expansion**
  - Approve further FOAF distributions to new communities, aligned with adoption and node growth

- **Marketplace Governance**
  - Decide which categories (e.g., food, services, tools) to open first and how to gate access to sensitive verticals

---

## üîç Why DAO Governance Matters

- **Community Control**  
  Ensures decisions reflect the needs of resilience-minded users, not external investors

- **Transparent Logic**  
  All rules, fees, and fund flows are verifiable on-chain

- **Trust-Chain Economics**  
  Users don‚Äôt need to hold tokens directly. FOAF stakers extend RHEO into the network via social credit paths, and DAO participants govern how that flow behaves

- **Regulatory Decentralization**  
  Distributed control, pseudonymous access, and non-custodial value routing minimize regulatory bottlenecks

---

## üó≥ Example Governance Flow

- **Proposal**: Reduce multi-hop routing fee from 3% to 2.5% to encourage intermediary participation
- **Action**: A gardener in Kaslo stakes 100 FOAF and submits the proposal
- **Vote**: 10% of staked FOAF holders participate; the majority approves
- **Execution**: Smart contract updates routing fee logic; the change goes live within 72 hours

---

## üî≠ Next Steps

- **Late 2025**: Deploy governance contracts and begin community-led decision testing via explainer videos
- **Mid 2026**: Pilot DAO voting during the May alpha launch across multiple communities
- **2027**: Mature the DAO alongside full FOAF marketplace deployment
