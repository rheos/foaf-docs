# FOAF Foundation DAO Transition

The **FOAF Foundation** is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) designed to empower communities through decentralized trading, starting with the **Growoperative app** and scaling to the **FOAF marketplace**. This document outlines the transition to full DAO governance, ensuring community control over fees, development, and expansion. The transition supports the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations, aligning with per-unit pricing in local fiat currency, flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit, or RHEO if accepted), and explainer videos for adoption.

## Transition Plan
- **Current State (2025)**: The FOAF Foundation operates with a founding team (see [team in pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)), managing the Growoperative PWA and initial token distribution.
- **Q4 2023–Q4 2024**: Gradual transition to DAO governance, with key milestones:
  - **Smart Contract Deployment**: Launch FOAF staking and voting contracts for governance proposals.
  - **Community Onboarding**: Distribute 8M FOAF (32% of supply) via airdrops to gardeners and resilience groups (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
  - **Pilot Governance**: Test DAO voting with Crawford Bay alpha participants on fee adjustments and app features.
- **Full DAO (Q4 2024)**: Complete transition, with all major decisions (e.g., RHEO fees, marketplace expansion) governed by FOAF token holders.

## Governance Mechanics
- **FOAF Tokens**: 25M fixed supply, used for staking and voting. 1 FOAF = 1 vote, weighted by stake duration.
- **Proposals**: Any FOAF holder can submit proposals (e.g., fee changes, video funding). Minimum stake required to propose.
- **Voting**: Quorum of 10% of staked FOAF, with majority approval. Pseudonymous participation via wallet addresses.
- **Execution**: Approved proposals are implemented via smart contracts or treasury funding (30% of RHEO fees).

## Key Decisions for DAO
- **Fee Adjustments**: Modify the 3% RHEO transaction fee or action fees (e.g., 0.25 RHEO for listing).
- **Development Priorities**: Allocate treasury funds (e.g., $300K for native apps, explainer videos).
- **Airdrop Expansion**: Approve additional FOAF distributions for new communities.
- **Marketplace Growth**: Guide the FOAF marketplace’s scope (e.g., tools, services).

## Why It Matters
- **Community Control**: DAO governance ensures resilience groups worldwide shape the platform.
- **Transparency**: All votes and funds are on-chain, verifiable by participants.
- **Scalability**: Supports multi-location launches, with videos simplifying governance for non-technical users.
- **Regulatory Strategy**: Pseudonymous participation and decentralized control minimize centralized oversight.

## Example Governance
- **Proposal**: Reduce listing fee from 0.25 RHEO to 0.2 RHEO to boost adoption.
- **Process**: A gardener stakes 100 FOAF, submits proposal, and 10% of staked FOAF votes. Majority approves, and smart contract updates the fee.
- **Outcome**: Lower fees increase listings, benefiting Crawford Bay and global users.

## Next Steps
- **2025**: Deploy governance contracts and onboard alpha testers via explainer videos.
- **2026**: Test DAO voting during May 2026 alpha in multiple locations.
- **2027**: Scale governance with FOAF marketplace launch.
