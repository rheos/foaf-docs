# FOAF Marketplace Vision

The **FOAF Marketplace** is the next step in the mission of the FOAF Foundation. It takes the core idea behind GrowOperative, which is local trade supported by trust and mutual credit, and expands it to include services, tools, skills, and shared labor.

This is not just about food. It is about creating an entire economic layer that helps people exchange value without relying on cash. Whether you need to borrow a drill, paint a fence, get tutoring, or trade childcare with a neighbor, the marketplace gives you a simple way to do it using a trust path instead of a price tag.

## What It Enables

- **Trade Anything**  
  Go beyond surplus produce. Exchange time, skills, tools, repairs, services, or shared resources.

- **Keep Your Money for What Matters**  
  People can save their cash for rent and bills while using mutual credit and trust-based trade for everyday needs.

- **Socially Routed Value**  
  RHEO flows through the network based on trust. You do not need to hold it directly. Everyone earns access through participation.

- **Community at the Center**  
  The marketplace is not managed from above. It is shaped by local activity and DAO governance as new needs emerge.

---

## How It Works

- **Mutual Credit and RHEO**  
  All trades are valued in local fiat currency but settled using credit, cash, or RHEO. Fees are paid in RHEO automatically through trust connections.

- **Trust Paths, Not Platforms**  
  Items or services can be listed as “contacts only.” They flow outward through social links, allowing trusted intermediaries to relay the offer with or without a markup.

- **Accessible Everywhere**  
  The marketplace will be available on the web and as mobile apps, but the experience is driven by the people who use it. It does not rely on centralized servers or payment processors.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Resilience Through Exchange**  
  When money is scarce, trust and cooperation can still move value. FOAF makes that possible at scale.

- **No Crypto Knowledge Required**  
  You do not need to understand tokens, wallets, or ledgers. You simply participate, and the system handles routing behind the scenes.

- **Governed by the People Who Use It**  
  Those who use the system get to help govern it. You can vote on changes once you stake FOAF and participate in DAO decisions.

## A Simple Example

- **Alice** offers tutoring for $10 per hour to her direct contacts.
- **Bob**, a trusted contact, lists Alice’s time to **Clara** for $12 per hour.
- Clara books 2 hours of tutoring. She now owes Bob $24 in credit.
- Bob owes Alice $20, and the fees in RHEO are distributed automatically.
- Everyone benefits. Clara learns, Bob earns credit, and Alice provides value.

---

## Looking Ahead

- The GrowOperative alpha tests the trust-routing model in multiple locations throughout 2026.
- The marketplace will follow, expanding the same system to broader trade.
- A full roadmap is available in [docs/technical/roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)
