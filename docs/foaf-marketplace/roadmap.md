# FOAF Marketplace Roadmap

The **FOAF Marketplace** is the **FOAF Foundation**’s vision to scale decentralized trading beyond the **Growoperative app**, enabling communities to trade diverse goods and services (e.g., tools, skills) using a friend-of-a-friend trust network. This roadmap outlines the development and launch plan, building on the May 2026 Growoperative alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations. It supports per-unit pricing in local fiat currency, flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit, or RHEO if accepted), and explainer videos for adoption, fostering community resilience and fiat independence.

## Milestones
- **2025**:
  - Enhance Growoperative PWA to include payment and mutual credit tracking (recorded as fiat IOUs, e.g., “$5 CAD owed”).
  - Develop explainer videos for marketing and onboarding, targeting resilience groups via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook.
  - Secure $300K funding to support marketplace groundwork (see [pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)).
- **Q2 2026**:
  - Launch native iOS/Android apps for Growoperative’s May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay and multiple interested communities.
  - Test trust network mechanics (global or contacts-only listings, markups by intermediaries).
  - Release instructional videos to simplify listing (e.g., “$10 CAD per hour for tutoring”) and trading.
- **Q4 2026**:
  - Develop FOAF Marketplace prototype, integrating diverse goods/services.
  - Pilot marketplace features with select alpha communities, refining based on feedback.
  - Expand airdrops (8M FOAF tokens) to onboard new users (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
- **2027**:
  - Launch FOAF Marketplace with full support for per-unit fiat pricing, mutual credit, and RHEO settlements.
  - Deploy marketing videos to drive global adoption, emphasizing resilience and scalability.
  - Transition to full DAO governance for marketplace decisions (see [dao-transition](../foaf-foundation/dao-transition.md)).
- **2028 and Beyond**:
  - Scale to include advanced features (e.g., service subscriptions, cross-community trading hubs).
  - Support global resilience networks with localized pricing and trust networks.

## Key Features
- **Diverse Trading**: List goods/services with per-unit prices in local fiat (e.g., $2 CAD per lb for tomatoes, $15 CAD per hour for repairs).
- **Trust Network**: Global or contacts-only visibility, with markups by intermediaries (e.g., $3 CAD per lb via a contact).
- **Settlement Options**: Cash, mutual credit (fiat-based IOUs), or RHEO (if accepted), with a 3% RHEO transaction fee.
- **Explainer Videos**: Simplify onboarding and trading for non-technical users across locations.

## Example Milestone (Q2 2026)
- **Alpha Test**: A user in Crawford Bay lists “Carpentry, $20 CAD per hour,” contacts-only. Their contact in Kaslo offers it at $25 CAD per hour. A trade settles in mutual credit ($50 CAD for 2 hours), with fees (0.75 RHEO) supporting the system.
- **Outcome**: Validates trust network and prepares for marketplace expansion.

## Why It Matters
- **Resilience**: Enables communities to trade diverse resources, reducing fiat dependence.
- **Scalability**: Multi-location launches ensure global reach, starting with alpha communities.
- **Sustainability**: RHEO fees (50% to nodes, 30% to treasury, 20% burned) ensure longevity.
- **Accessibility**: Videos and fiat pricing lower barriers for gardeners and beyond.
