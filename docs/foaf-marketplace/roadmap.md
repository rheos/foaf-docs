# FOAF Marketplace Roadmap

The FOAF Marketplace builds on the foundations of GrowOperative to create a wider network of decentralized trade. It is designed to support the exchange of services, tools, and time between people who trust each other. This roadmap outlines how we move from the first alpha pilots into a full-featured marketplace guided by the FOAF DAO.

The Marketplace does not replace GrowOperative. It grows from it. By building on trust paths and mutual credit, we aim to support a new kind of community commerce where people can meet everyday needs without relying on cash.

## 2028 and Beyond

## Marketplace Features

- **Flexible Listings**  
  Offer services, tools, and help with per-unit pricing in local currency

- **Trust-Based Discovery**  
  Items and services can be shared with friends only or propagated to wider networks through trusted intermediaries

- **Settlement Options**  
  Use cash, mutual credit, or RHEO. All fees are in RHEO and flow automatically through trust chains

- **Transparent Fees**  
  Three percent of each trade value in RHEO, plus one percent per intermediary hop, routed fairly with no central control

- **Media for Learning**  
  Video explainers are released at every phase to help new users understand and participate quickly

---

## Why It Matters

- **Builds Resilience**  
  Communities can meet needs directly without waiting for outside help

- **Grows Organically**  
  The system grows through relationships and participation, not venture capital or paid adoption

- **Supports Self-Reliance**  
  Families and neighbors can help each other without needing to spend money they do not have

- **DAO-Governed**  
  Control remains in the hands of the people who use it, guided by FOAF token holders and active trust builders
