# FOAF Foundation Airdrops

The **FOAF Foundation** uses airdrops to distribute **FOAF tokens**, bootstrapping adoption of the **GrowOperative app** and building the trust-layered ecosystem behind the future **FOAF marketplace**.

FOAF tokens are issued directly to gardeners, resilience communities, node builders, and contributors — enabling them to earn RHEO via staking, participate in governance, and extend access to others through trust chains.

## Airdrop Overview

- **Allocation**: 2.5M–3M FOAF tokens (10–12% of 25M total supply)

## Example Airdrop Flow

- **Task**: A gardener in Boulder lists “Zucchini, $2 USD/lb” and completes a trade
- **Reward**: 50 FOAF, stakable for RHEO generation or DAO voting
- **Outcome**: That user becomes a trusted source of liquidity and expands the network

---

## Why Airdrops Matter

- **Incentivized Growth**: Gardeners earn tokens for contributing abundance
- **Trust Chain Expansion**: FOAF creates credit pathways even for users without tokens
- **No Barriers**: Participation is free — tokens are earned, not bought
- **Sustainable**: Funded by the DAO treasury and reinforced by circulating RHEO fees
