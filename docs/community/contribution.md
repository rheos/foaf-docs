# FOAF Foundation Airdrops

The **FOAF Foundation** leverages airdrops to distribute **FOAF tokens**, fostering adoption of the **Growoperative app** and future **FOAF marketplace**. Airdrops incentivize gardeners, resilience groups, and contributors to join the decentralized trading ecosystem, supporting per-unit pricing in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD per lb), flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit as fiat IOUs, or RHEO if accepted), and a friend-of-a-friend trust network. This program targets the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations, with explainer videos aiding onboarding.

## Airdrop Overview
- **Allocation**: 8M FOAF tokens (32% of 25M total supply) reserved for airdrops.
- **Purpose**: Bootstrap community participation, reward early adopters, and expand the trust network.
- **Eligibility**: Gardeners, resilience group members, developers, and contributors in alpha communities.

## Distribution Plan
- **2025**:
  - Initial airdrop to Crawford Bay resilience groups via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook.
  - 1M FOAF distributed to early users who list goods (e.g., “Tomatoes, $2 CAD per lb”).
  - Tasks: Sign up, list items, or share explainer videos (hosted on X and YouTube).
- **Q2 2026**:
  - Expand airdrops for May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay and other interested communities (e.g., Kaslo, global resilience networks).
  - 3M FOAF for users completing trades (cash, mutual credit, or RHEO) or referring new users.
  - Video-based tasks: Share marketing videos to onboard multi-location participants.
- **Q4 2026**:
  - 2M FOAF for FOAF marketplace prototype testers, supporting diverse goods/services.
  - Reward contributions like bug reports or trust network expansion.
- **2027**:
  - Final 2M FOAF for global marketplace launch, targeting resilience communities.
  - Incentivize governance participation via DAO voting (see [dao-transition](../foaf-foundation/dao-transition.md)).

## Example Airdrop
- **Task**: A gardener in Crawford Bay lists “Zucchini, $1.50 CAD per lb” and completes a trade.
- **Reward**: 50 FOAF tokens, stakable for governance or future rewards.
- **Outcome**: User joins trust network, trades surplus, and earns voting power.

## Why It Matters
- **Adoption**: Airdrops drive engagement in multi-location alpha, encouraging gardeners to expand production.
- **Resilience**: Builds trust networks for cash-free trading (mutual credit as “$ owed” or RHEO).
- **Accessibility**: No upfront costs; users earn FOAF and RHEO via participation.
- **Sustainability**: Funded by treasury (30% of 3% RHEO fees), ensuring longevity.
