# FOAF Foundation Contribution Guide

GrowOperative is a community-first project powered by the **FOAF Foundation**, a decentralized network focused on local trade, mutual credit, and sustainable trust-based exchange. Whether you're a developer, gardener, designer, or organizer, your contributions can directly strengthen local resilience and help reduce reliance on centralized systems.

This guide outlines how to get involved as we prepare for the multi-location alpha in May 2026. From building code to translating documentation, every contribution helps grow the FOAF ecosystem.

## Why Contribute?

- **Empower Communities**: Enable gardeners to expand production and trade surplus, reducing waste.
- **Drive Resilience**: Build a fiat-independent economy with mutual credit and RHEO.
- **Shape the Future**: Participate in DAO governance beginning in late 2026.
- **Earn Rewards**: Receive FOAF tokens through airdrops (see [airdrops](./airdrops.md)).

## How to Contribute

### Documentation

- **Enhance Docs**: Improve clarity, add examples, or translate guides in `foaf-docs`.
  - Example: Update [onboarding](../growoperative/onboarding.md) with local fiat pricing tips.
- **Process**:
  1. Fork `foaf-docs` (https://github.com/rheos/foaf-docs.git).
  2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b doc-update`).
  3. Edit markdown files (e.g., add trust network examples).
  4. Submit a pull request with a clear description.
- **Needs**: User stories, video script ideas, guides for resilience groups.

### Code

- **Develop Features**: Enhance the PWA (Ruby on Rails, MySQL, React.js) or native apps (Q2 2026).
  - Example: Implement mutual credit tracking (fiat-based IOUs).
- **Process**:
  - Join the codebase repo (to be open-sourced Q4 2025) via GitHub Issues.
  - Tasks: Add RHEO fee logic, trust network markup support, or video integration.
- **Skills Needed**: Ruby on Rails, React.js, MySQL, Solidity, React Native.

Whether you're exploring casually, hoping to earn tokens, or interested in applying for a paid role, your contributions are welcome. This is an open door for both volunteers and potential team members.

### Community

You don't need to be a coder to help — feedback, outreach, and community building are just as valuable.

- **Spread the Word**: Share explainer videos or promote GrowOperative on Signal, Telegram, Facebook.
  - Example: Post about trading surplus in resilience groups.
- **Host Events**: Organize meetups in Crawford Bay or other alpha locations.
- **Feedback**: Submit ideas via GitHub Issues or app (post-launch).

## Guidelines

- **Respect**: Collaborate kindly, valuing diverse perspectives.
- **Standards**: Use markdown for docs, follow Ruby/React conventions for code.
- **Alignment**: Focus on resilience, inclusion, and decentralization (see [overview](../foaf-foundation/overview.md)).
- **Pseudonymity**: You can contribute under a pseudonym using a wallet address — no legal name or ID required.

## Example Contribution

- **Task**: A developer adds a feature to display markups in trust network trades (e.g., “$2.50 CAD per lb from Peter vs. $2 CAD from Bob”).
- **Process**: Submit pull request, earn 100 FOAF tokens via airdrop.
- **Outcome**: Enhances user experience, supports multi-location alpha.
