Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's how the complete request, confirmation, shipment, and supply chain management system works:

## **Supply Chain Management System Overview**

This is a multi-tier B2B supply chain platform that connects **Producers ‚Üí Brokers ‚Üí Retailers ‚Üí Consumers** with automated request routing, pricing, and order fulfillment.

### **üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture**

**User Hierarchy:**
- **Admin**: System administrator with full access
- **Producer**: Creates and owns original items/inventory
- **Broker/Wholesaler**: Intermediary traders who buy from producers and sell to retailers
- **Retailer**: Sells to consumers, can also act as intermediaries
- **Consumer**: End buyers who purchase from retailers

**Key Models:**
- `Item`: Product definition with category, grade, pricing
- `Inventory`: Actual stock owned by users with quantities and status
- `RequestContract`: Master contract for a supply chain request
- `ItemRequest`: Individual step in the supply chain
- `Order`: Groups related requests for shipment
- `Relationship`: Network connections between users

### **üìã Request & Confirmation Workflow**

#### **1. Request Creation**
```ruby
# When a user requests an item
POST /v1/items/:inventory_id/requests
```

**Path Finding Algorithm:**
- System uses **Dijkstra-like shortest path** algorithm to find optimal route
- Searches up to `MAX_DEPTH = 5` relationship levels
- Calculates total cost including markups at each step
- Creates multi-step `RequestContract` with individual `ItemRequest` per hop

**Example Chain:** Consumer ‚Üí Retailer ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí Producer
- Creates 3 `ItemRequest` records (one per relationship)
- Each has different pricing based on cumulative markups

#### **2. Confirmation Process**
```ruby
POST /v1/items/requests/:request_id/accept
```

**Status Flow:**
- `pending` ‚Üí User receives request, can accept/decline
- `accepted` ‚Üí Request confirmed, inventory becomes `reserved`
- `reserved` ‚Üí Inventory locked for this request chain
- `completed` ‚Üí Item shipped and received
- `cancelled` ‚Üí Request terminated

**Multi-Step Confirmation:**
- Each step in chain must be individually accepted
- Contract only proceeds when ALL steps are `accepted`
- Inventory status changes to `reserved` when contract is fully accepted

### **üöö Shipment & Order Management**

#### **3. Order Creation**
```ruby
# Orders group related requests between two users
Order.create(user_id: sender, friend_id: receiver)
```

**Order Aggregation:**
- Multiple `ItemRequest`s between same users get grouped into `Order`
- Orders have status: `pending` ‚Üí `shipped` ‚Üí `signed`
- Enables bulk shipping and receiving

#### **4. Shipping Process**
```ruby
POST /v1/items/requests/:request_id/ship
```

**Shipping Workflow:**
- Only inventory owner can ship
- Updates `shipped_at` timestamp
- Changes `ItemRequest` status to `completed`
- Order status becomes `shipped`

#### **5. Receiving/Signing**
```ruby
POST /v1/items/requests/:request_id/sign
```

**Ownership Transfer:**
- Receiver "signs" to confirm receipt
- **Inventory ownership transfers** to receiver
- Updates `signed_at` timestamp
- If multi-step chain, creates next order automatically

### **üí∞ Pricing & Markup System**

**Hierarchical Pricing:**
1. **Base Price**: Producer's original price
2. **Relationship Markup**: Custom markup between specific users
3. **Category Markup**: Default markup by product category
4. **Global Default**: System-wide default markup

```ruby
# Price calculation in helpers/item_helper.rb
def get_relation_price(user_id, friend_id)
  # 1. Check custom relationship price
  relation_price = UserRelationshipPrice.find_by(user_id: user_id, friend_id: friend_id)
  return relation_price.price if relation_price&.price
  
  # 2. Fall back to user's category markup
  return get_user_markup(user_id)
end
```

**Final Price = Base Price + Sum(Markups for each step in chain)**

### **üìä Dashboard Views by User Type**

**Producer Dashboard:**
- **My Store**: Items they've created
- **Requested**: Incoming requests for their items
- **Shipped**: Items they've sent out

**Broker/Retailer Dashboard:**
- **Available**: Items they can purchase from network
- **Requested**: Items they've requested from others
- **Holding**: Items they own (received from others)
- **Shipped**: Items they've sent to customers
- **My Store**: Items they're selling

**Consumer Dashboard:**
- **Available**: Items from connected retailers
- **Requested**: Items they've requested
- Simplified view with unit options (oz, bottles, etc.)

### **üîÑ Multi-Tier Chain Example**

**Scenario:** Consumer wants apples from Producer
1. **Path Discovery**: Consumer ‚Üí Retailer ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí Producer
2. **Contract Creation**: 
   - `RequestContract` with `steps: 3`
   - 3 `ItemRequest` records created
3. **Acceptance Chain**:
   - Producer accepts (step 3)
   - Broker accepts (step 2) 
   - Retailer accepts (step 1)
4. **Shipping Chain**:
   - Producer ships to Broker
   - Broker receives & signs ‚Üí ownership transfers
   - Broker ships to Retailer  
   - Retailer receives & signs ‚Üí ownership transfers
   - Retailer ships to Consumer
   - Consumer receives & signs ‚Üí final ownership transfer

### **üéØ Key Features**

**Smart Routing**: Automatically finds shortest/cheapest path through supply network
**Atomic Transactions**: Full chain must be accepted or entire request fails
**Inventory Management**: Real-time status tracking (available/reserved/shipped)
**Flexible Pricing**: Relationship-based markups with fallbacks
**Order Batching**: Multiple items between users grouped for efficiency
**Ownership Tracking**: Clear chain of custody with timestamps
**Role-Based Access**: Different capabilities based on user type

This system enables complex B2B supply chains to operate efficiently with automated routing, transparent pricing, and reliable order fulfillment tracking.
