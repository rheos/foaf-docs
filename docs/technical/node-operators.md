# FOAF Node Operator Guide

Node operators help power the FOAF network by providing trusted access points for communities. While the FOAF platform is designed to work with or without central servers, node operators play an important role in helping new users onboard, routing credit through trust paths, and keeping things running smoothly.

## What is a FOAF Node?

A FOAF node is a participant in the network who helps others connect, route trades, and access the system. This may include:

- Hosting a local copy of the GrowOperative or Marketplace backend
- Providing access to users without phones or internet
- Accepting RHEO routing requests and forwarding them through their trust chain
- Helping users settle credit or find what they need in the network

---

## Why It Matters

Most users will join FOAF through a social connection. Node operators strengthen the web of trust by making it easier to onboard new people and pass value along. They are rewarded with RHEO whenever they help route a trade, and they may also be eligible for FOAF airdrops or DAO roles.

## What You Will Need

You do not need to be a developer to operate a node, but some basic tech knowledge helps. A typical node setup includes:

- A stable internet connection and access to a computer or hosted server
- A wallet address to receive RHEO and FOAF rewards
- A few trusted contacts to help bootstrap your portion of the trust network
- A willingness to help neighbors trade and grow

---

## Responsibilities

- Route RHEO fees between users when trades move through you
- Optionally host the frontend or backend of the platform for your community
- Help new users join by sharing onboarding videos or answering questions
- Keep your contact list healthy by only inviting people you trust to follow through on trades

---

## Rewards

Every time a trade flows through you as an intermediary, you earn a portion of the fee. You may also:

- Receive FOAF tokens for participating early
- Propose system changes once DAO governance is active
- Be invited to help moderate, translate, or extend the network in your region

## Next Steps

If you are interested in becoming a node operator:

1. Talk to your local community to see if this fits
2. Reach out through our Signal or Telegram groups
3. Watch the explainer videos about routing and trust path settlement
4. Prepare to install or host a simple version of the app if needed
