# FOAF Foundation Technical Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the FOAF ecosystem. It begins with GrowOperative and expands into a broader marketplace for trust-based, fiat-independent trade. Each milestone supports our mission of building community-owned infrastructure for everyday exchange.

## 2025

### GrowOperative Platform

- Add support for mutual credit and fiat-denominated IOUs in the backend
- Improve per-unit pricing and trade logic in the user interface
- Refine visibility and trust-routing UX for contact-based trading

### Blockchain and DAO Infrastructure

- Deploy initial FOAF and RHEO smart contracts
- Implement RHEO transaction fees (3 percent of value) and trust-routing premiums (1 percent per hop)
- Begin DAO tooling for staking, voting, and treasury disbursement

### Outreach and Preparation

- Produce onboarding videos explaining listing, trust-based trades, and settlement paths
- Begin grassroots outreach to early resilience hubs
- Raise $300K to fund development, apps, content, and infrastructure

## Why It Matters

- **Resilience**: Enables trading and collaboration when money is scarce or supply chains are unreliable
- **Ease of Use**: People can join with no tokens, no technical setup, and no exposure to crypto complexity
- **Self Funding**: Every trade sustains the network through small RHEO flows
- **Growth by Trust**: Trade expands through social networks, not ads or extractive platforms
