# FOAF Foundation Technical Roadmap

The **FOAF Foundation** drives decentralized trading through the **Growoperative app** and future **FOAF marketplace**, with a technical roadmap to ensure robust development and scalability. This roadmap supports per-unit pricing in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD per lb), flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit as fiat IOUs, or RHEO if accepted), and a friend-of-a-friend trust network, enabling the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations. Explainer videos will aid adoption.

## 2025
- **PWA Enhancements**:
  - Integrate payment tracking and mutual credit system (recorded as fiat IOUs, e.g., “$4 CAD owed”) into Ruby on Rails backend with MySQL.
  - Add support for per-unit pricing in local fiat (e.g., $2 CAD per lb).
- **Blockchain Integration**:
  - Deploy Ethereum smart contracts for FOAF (governance) and RHEO (3% transaction fee, action fees like 0.25 RHEO for listing).
  - Implement multi-hop trade fees (+0.1 RHEO per hop).
- **Videos**: Produce initial explainer videos for listing, trading, and trust network mechanics, hosted on X and YouTube.
- **Funding**: Secure $300K for development, videos, and marketing (see [pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)).

## Q2 2026
- **Native Apps**:
  - Launch iOS/Android apps, replacing PWA for the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay and other communities.
  - Support global or contacts-only listings with markups (e.g., $2.50 CAD per lb vs. $2 CAD).
- **Alpha Testing**:
  - Test trust network, fiat pricing, and settlement options (cash, credit, RHEO if accepted).
  - Use videos to onboard users across multiple locations.
- **Community Feedback**: Refine based on alpha user input via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook groups.

## Q4 2026
- **Marketplace Prototype**:
  - Extend backend to support diverse goods/services (e.g., $15 CAD per hour for repairs).
  - Enhance MySQL schema for broader trade categories.
- **Airdrops**: Distribute 8M FOAF tokens to new users (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
- **Video Expansion**: Release additional marketing videos to promote multi-location adoption.

## 2027
- **FOAF Marketplace Launch**:
  - Deploy full marketplace with native apps, supporting global resilience networks.
  - Integrate advanced features like reputation systems and cross-community trading.
- **DAO Governance**: Complete transition to DAO control for technical decisions (see [dao-transition](../foaf-foundation/dao-transition.md)).
- **Scalability**: Optimize Rails/MySQL and blockchain for high trade volumes.

## Why It Matters
- **Resilience**: Enables fiat-independent trading across communities.
- **Accessibility**: Fiat pricing and videos lower barriers for non-technical users.
- **Sustainability**: RHEO fees (50% to nodes, 30% to treasury, 20% burned) ensure longevity.
- **Scalability**: Multi-location alpha paves the way for global expansion.
