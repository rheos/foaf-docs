# FOAF Foundation Technical Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the FOAF ecosystem. It begins with GrowOperative and scales toward a broader marketplace for trust-based, fiat-independent trade. Each milestone supports our goal of creating resilient, community-owned infrastructure that works in everyday life.

---

## 2025

### GrowOperative Platform

- Add support for mutual credit and fiat-based IOUs to the backend
- Improve per-unit pricing and trade matching logic
- Prepare frontend UX for trust-based routing and contact visibility

### Blockchain and DAO Infrastructure

- Deploy initial FOAF and RHEO smart contracts
- Implement RHEO fee logic for transaction value (3 percent) and per-hop trust routing (1 percent premium per hop)
- Begin DAO tooling development for staking, voting, and treasury flows

### Media and Outreach

- Produce onboarding videos for listing items, trust-based trades, and community credit
- Begin outreach to early resilience communities in BC and elsewhere
- Raise $300K to fund development, video production, and mobile app support  
  (see [pitch deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md))

---

## Q2 2026

### Native App Launch

- Release mobile apps on iOS and Android to replace the PWA
- Support trust-path trade routing with visibility controls and markups

### Alpha Testing

- Launch GrowOperative alpha in multiple locations
- Validate RHEO fee handling, credit flows, and contact-based propagation
- Collect feedback through early user groups and community chats

### Education and Engagement

- Use explainer videos to help participants understand mutual credit and social trade
- Support local organizers in setting up nodes or sharing trusted access

---

## Q4 2026

### FOAF Marketplace Prototype

- Expand listing types to support services and time-based offers
- Extend backend to track broader trade categories and deeper contact chains
- Finalize governance onboarding materials for alpha DAO participants

### Token Distribution

- Execute phased FOAF airdrops based on contribution and trade activity  
  (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md))

### Outreach and Feedback

- Release new explainer videos focused on services, labor, and social credit
- Evaluate alpha data and propose upgrades through DAO participation

---

## 2027

### FOAF Marketplace Launch

- Open full marketplace functionality across multiple trade categories
- Integrate reputation system to support social trust scoring and delegation
- Optimize database and smart contract performance for scale

### Governance and Autonomy

- Transition key technical and treasury decisions to on-chain DAO proposals  
  (see [dao-transition](../foaf-foundation/dao-transition.md))

- Begin community-sourced development funding through treasury votes

## Why It Matters

- **Resilience**: Enables communities to trade value even when cash is limited
- **Accessibility**: People can join and use the system with no tokens and no technical setup
- **Sustainability**: Fees in RHEO fund infrastructure and contributors automatically
- **Scalability**: Trust-path routing and local credit let this grow from one garden to an entire economy
