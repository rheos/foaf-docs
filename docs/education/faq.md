# FOAF Foundation Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions about FOAF, GrowOperative, mutual credit, and the broader marketplace.

---

## What is FOAF?

FOAF stands for Friend of a Friend. It is a network for trust-based trading. Instead of relying on banks or big platforms, people exchange value directly through their contacts and the contacts of their contacts.

---

## What is GrowOperative?

GrowOperative is the first app built on the FOAF network. It lets gardeners and neighbors trade surplus food and other goods with one another. It supports mutual credit and trust-based routing, with no need for tokens or cash up front.

---

## Do I need tokens to participate?

No. You do not need to buy or hold any tokens. Fees are paid in RHEO, but they flow automatically through trust paths. You can join through a friend or community contact and start trading without setting up a wallet.

---

## What is mutual credit?

Mutual credit is a system where people give and receive without needing cash at the moment of trade. When you provide value, your account goes positive. When you receive something, you might go negative. It is like a running balance between friends, but supported by simple records and trust.

---

## What happens if I owe someone and do not pay?

The system works through relationships. If you owe someone and do not settle, your reputation will affect how others choose to interact with you. Trades are visible to those involved and to your trust path, which creates gentle accountability.

---

## How are fees handled?

Each trade includes a small fee. Three percent of the total value is collected in RHEO. If the trade is relayed through one or more contacts, each hop adds a one percent routing premium. These fees support node operators, fund development, and keep the system sustainable.

---

## What is RHEO?

RHEO is the utility token used to power the FOAF network. It is not a currency. It simply carries the cost of using the system. Most users will never need to hold it directly. It flows behind the scenes through trusted participants.

---

## What is FOAF (the token)?

FOAF is a separate token used for governance. It has a fixed supply and is used to vote on proposals and help shape the future of the network. Some contributors and organizers may earn FOAF through participation.

---

## Is this like barter?

No. Barter requires two people to want what each other has at the same time. FOAF uses credit and trust to let value flow through the network more freely. You can receive something now and provide something later to someone else.

---

## Is this like crypto?

Not really. FOAF uses blockchain to manage governance and fees, but the system works through social trust, not speculation. You can participate without understanding crypto or ever touching a wallet.

---

## Can I use this if I do not have a smartphone?

Yes. You can access the system through a browser using the PWA. In the future, trusted node operators may offer printed listings, in-person matching, or community kiosks.

---

## Who runs the network?

Nobody and everybody. The FOAF Foundation coordinates early development, but the network is governed by its users. Anyone who earns or holds FOAF can participate in proposals and help guide future decisions.

---

## How do I start?

You can join through a trusted contact, a local resilience group, or by signing up on the platform. Once you're in, you can list something you have or request something already listed. The videos and onboarding materials will walk you through the rest.
