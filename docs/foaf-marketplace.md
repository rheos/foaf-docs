# FOAF Marketplace Vision

The **FOAF Marketplace** is the next evolution of the **FOAF Foundation**’s mission to foster community resilience and fiat independence through decentralized trading. Building on the **Growoperative app**’s success with gardening surplus, the marketplace expands to include diverse goods and services (e.g., tools, childcare, skills), creating a global, trust-based economy. This vision supports the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other locations, using per-unit pricing in local fiat currency, flexible trade settlements (cash, mutual credit, or RHEO if accepted), and explainer videos for adoption.

## Core Vision
- **Expand Beyond Gardening**: Enable communities to trade anything of value, from handmade furniture to tutoring, using the friend-of-a-friend trust network.
- **Fiat Independence**: Encourage cash-free trading with mutual credit (recorded as fiat IOUs, e.g., “$5 CAD owed”) or RHEO, while allowing cash settlements.
- **Global Scalability**: Launch in multiple locations, supported by DAO governance and airdrops (8M FOAF tokens).
- **Sustainability**: Fund operations with a 3% RHEO transaction fee, eliminating volunteer burnout.

## Key Features
- **Diverse Listings**: List goods/services with per-unit prices in local fiat (e.g., $10 CAD per hour for tutoring), with quantities or hours specified.
- **Trust Network**: Choose global visibility or contacts-only, with items propagating through contacts’ contacts, allowing markups (e.g., $12 CAD per hour via an intermediary).
- **Flexible Settlements**: Settle in cash, mutual credit, or RHEO (if accepted), with credit recorded in local fiat.
- **Reputation System**: Build trust through ratings, ensuring reliable trades across communities.
- **Explainer Videos**: Marketing and instructional videos simplify onboarding, launching with the marketplace in 2027.

## Why It Matters
- **Resilient Economies**: Enables communities to trade diverse resources, reducing reliance on fragile supply chains.
- **Inclusive Access**: No tokens required; RHEO fees are earned via trades or airdrops (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).
- **Community-Driven**: DAO governance (Q4 2024) ensures users shape the marketplace’s future.
- **Scalable Impact**: From Crawford Bay to global resilience networks, supported by videos and grassroots outreach.

## Example Trade
- **Alice Lists**: Tutoring at $10 CAD per hour, contacts-only.
- **Bob (Alice’s Contact)**: Offers it at $12 CAD per hour to his contact, Clara.
- **Trade**: Clara books 2 hours ($24 CAD, mutual credit). Bob settles with Alice for $20 CAD credit.
- **Fees**: Bob pays 0.72 RHEO (3% on $24) if RHEO used; Alice pays 0.6 RHEO (3% on $20).
- **Outcome**: Clara learns, Alice and Bob earn, and the system is sustained.

## Roadmap
- **2026**: Leverage Growoperative’s alpha to test trust network mechanics in multiple locations.
- **Q4 2026**: Develop marketplace prototype, integrating diverse listings.
- **2027**: Launch FOAF Marketplace with native apps and explainer videos.

## Funding
- **$300K Need**: Funds native apps, videos, and marketplace development (see [pitch-deck](../growoperative/pitch-deck.md)).
- **Impact**: Scales resilient trading globally, starting with community pilots.
