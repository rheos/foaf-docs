Fully allocated to cover:
- Modest founder salary

- Grant application support
- Minor team extensions or infrastructure scale

### ðŸŸ¢ Optional Token Substitution

Contributors may optionally choose to receive part or all of their compensation in **FOAF tokens** valued at **$0.06 per token**, instead of cash. This decision is entirely voluntary and based on their confidence in the projectâ€™s long-term vision. Token-based compensation may be subject to vesting terms negotiated individually.

In the event of runway pressure or scaling needs, the **team allocation (5M FOAF)** may also be partially used to raise additional funds through future token sales at higher valuations, subject to vesting and governance transparency.

- Extensible via DAO treasury, further grants, or a strategic round (5â€“10% FOAF)
- Goal: reach self-sustaining DAO and trust-chain liquidity by end of 2026
