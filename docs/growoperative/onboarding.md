# GrowOperative Onboarding Guide

**GrowOperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowering communities to trade gardening surplus using flexible, trust-based settlement. This guide helps gardeners, neighbors, and resilience enthusiasts list what they have, request items already listed, and participate in a decentralized network that supports sustainable food systems. Instructional explainer videos will launch alongside the May 2026 alpha.

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the App
- Use the Progressive Web App (PWA) at launch (May 2026); mobile apps follow.
- No crypto experience needed — just a phone, browser, or simple wallet if you want one.
- Explainer videos guide you through setup.

### 2. Create an Account
- Sign up with email or an optional wallet.
- Connect with local groups or friends to build your trust chain.

### 3. List What You Have
- Add items (e.g., “Tomatoes, $2 per lb”) with photos, per-unit pricing in local fiat currency, and quantity.
- Choose visibility: global or “contacts only” (visible to direct contacts and theirs).
- No listing fee at launch.

### 4. Request Existing Listings
- Browse listed items and request what you need.
- You **cannot post general “wanted” requests** — only respond to existing offers.
- Intermediate contacts may offer items at a markup.

### 5. Settle the Trade
- Choose cash (PayPal, eTransfer, Venmo), mutual credit (IOUs), or RHEO.
- All trades incur a **3% fee on trade value**, paid by the seller or intermediary.
- If there’s a markup, a **3% fee on markup** also applies.
- RHEO is required for all fees but flows automatically via trust chains — you don’t need to hold it directly.
- Multi-hop trust chains apply a **1% routing premium per hop**.

## Example Trade

- **Bob Lists**: Tomatoes at $2 per lb, 5 lbs available, contacts-only.
- **Peter (Bob’s Contact)**: Requests 1 lb at $2.
- **Paul and Sara (Peter’s Contacts)**: See the same tomatoes, offered via Peter at $2.50/lb.
- **Final Trade**:
  - Peter buys 3 lbs from Bob ($6 total).
  - Sells 1 lb each to Paul and Sara ($5 total).
  - Fees apply:
    - Bob pays 3% on $6 = 0.18 RHEO
    - Peter pays 3% on $5 = 0.15 RHEO (if RHEO used)
    - If routing through others, each hop adds 1% premium

## Key Concepts

- **Local Pricing**: All items are priced per unit in the local fiat currency (e.g., USD, CAD, etc.).
- **No Token Barrier**: You don’t need to buy tokens — RHEO flows from FOAF holders via trust chains.
- **No Listing Requests**: Only list what you have. Browse to request items already listed.
- **Trust Network**: Listings can propagate through social trust paths, enabling broader reach.
- **No Action Fees at Launch**: Listing and claiming are free during alpha; only RHEO-based value fees apply.
