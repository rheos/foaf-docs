# Growoperative Onboarding Guide

**Growoperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowering communities to trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes, herbs) using flexible settlement options. This guide helps gardeners, neighbors, and resilience enthusiasts join the platform, list goods, and trade, fostering sustainable food systems and local resilience. Instructional explainer videos will accompany this guide to simplify the process, launching alongside the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other interested communities worldwide.

## Why Join?
- **Expand Your Garden**: Grow more knowing your surplus has a reliable market, reducing waste and boosting local food production.
- **Reduce Food Waste**: Share excess produce, addressing the $1,600/year household waste problem (Pitch Deck Page 6).
- **Build Community**: Trade with neighbors, strengthening local ties via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook resilience groups.
- **Flexible Trading**: Settle trades with cash or mutual credit, with RHEO as an optional substitute for cash if agreed.
- **Sustain the System**: A 3% RHEO transaction fee supports maintainers, eliminating volunteer burnout.

## Getting Started
1. **Access the App**:
   - Use the Progressive Web App (PWA) at launch (May 2026), with native iOS/Android apps to follow.
   - Watch the **explainer video** (available on X and YouTube) for a quick setup overview.
   - No crypto knowledge required; the interface is gardener-friendly.
2. **Create an Account**:
   - Sign up with an email or pseudonymous wallet address.
   - Connect with friends or local resilience groups to build your trust network.
3. **List Your Surplus**:
   - Add items (e.g., “5 lbs tomatoes”) with photos and a price in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD).
   - Listing fee: 0.25 RHEO (earned later if no tokens yet).
   - See the **instructional video** on listing for tips.
4. **Browse and Trade**:
   - Search for goods (e.g., bread, zucchini), priced in local fiat (e.g., $3 CAD).
   - Request a trade, paying a 0.5 RHEO claiming fee.
   - Settle with cash or mutual credit; RHEO can replace cash for credit settlements if both parties agree (3% RHEO fee applies).
   - Watch the **trading video** for a step-by-step guide.
5. **Settle Credits**:
   - Mutual credit allows IOUs, settled later with cash, RHEO (if accepted), or goods/services (1 RHEO settlement fee).
   - Multi-hop trades (via trusted friends) cost +0.1 RHEO per hop.

## Pricing and Fees
- **Local Fiat Pricing**: All items are priced in local fiat currency (e.g., CAD in Canada).
- **Settlement Options**:
  - **Cash**: Pay the listed fiat amount.
  - **Mutual Credit**: Earn/spend credits equivalent to the fiat price.
  - **RHEO**: Use as a cash substitute for credit settlements, if agreed (valued at community rates, initially 1 RHEO ≈ $1 CAD in 2026).
- **Fees**:
  - 3% RHEO transaction fee (e.g., 0.06 RHEO on a $2 CAD trade, if RHEO used).
  - Action fees: 0.25 RHEO (listing), 0.5 RHEO (claiming), 1 RHEO (credit settlement).
- **No Tokens Needed**: Earn RHEO through trades or airdrops (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).

## Example Trade
- **You List**: 5 lbs tomatoes for $2 CAD.
- **Neighbor Requests**: Pays 0.5 RHEO claiming fee and chooses mutual credit.
- **Trade Completes**: You deliver tomatoes, they owe 2 credits; no RHEO fee if settled later in cash. If RHEO used, you pay 0.06 RHEO (3% fee).
- **Outcome**: You get bread, they get tomatoes, and the system is sustained.
