# Growoperative Onboarding Guide

**Growoperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowering communities to trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes, herbs) using flexible settlement options. This guide helps gardeners, neighbors, and resilience enthusiasts join the platform, list goods, and trade, fostering sustainable food systems and local resilience. Instructional explainer videos will accompany this guide to simplify the process, launching alongside the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other interested communities worldwide.

## Why Join?
- **Expand Your Garden**: Grow more knowing your surplus has a reliable market, reducing waste and boosting local food production.
- **Reduce Food Waste**: Share excess produce, addressing the $1,600/year household waste problem (Pitch Deck Page 6).
- **Build Community**: Trade with neighbors, strengthening local ties via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook resilience groups.
- **Flexible Trading**: Settle trades with cash or mutual credit (recorded in local fiat currency), with RHEO as an optional cash substitute if agreed.
- **Sustain the System**: A 3% RHEO transaction fee supports maintainers, eliminating volunteer burnout.

## Getting Started
1. **Access the App**:
   - Use the Progressive Web App (PWA) at launch (May 2026), with native iOS/Android apps to follow.
   - Watch the **explainer video** (available on X and YouTube) for a quick setup overview.
   - No crypto knowledge required; the interface is gardener-friendly.
2. **Create an Account**:
   - Sign up with an email or pseudonymous wallet address.
   - Connect with friends or local resilience groups to build your trust network.
3. **List Your Surplus**:
   - Add items (e.g., “Tomatoes, $2 CAD per lb”) with photos, per-unit price in local fiat currency, quantity (e.g., 5 lbs), and visibility (global or contacts-only).
   - Contacts-only items are visible to your direct contacts and their contacts, appearing as if offered by your contact.
   - Listing fee: 0.25 RHEO (earned later if no tokens yet).
   - See the **instructional video** on listing for tips.
4. **Browse and Trade**:
   - Search for goods (e.g., “Bread, $3 CAD per loaf”), priced per unit in local fiat.
   - Request a trade, paying a 0.5 RHEO claiming fee, and agree on quantity (e.g., 2 lbs tomatoes for $4 CAD).
   - Intermediate contacts may add a markup (e.g., $2.50 CAD per lb vs. $2 CAD from the source), set by market dynamics.
   - Settle with cash or mutual credit; RHEO can replace cash for credit settlements if both parties agree (3% RHEO fee applies).
   - Watch the **trading video** for a step-by-step guide, including trust network trades.
5. **Settle Credits**:
   - Mutual credit is recorded as IOUs in local fiat (e.g., “Paul owes Peter $2.50 CAD”).
   - Settle IOUs with cash, RHEO (if accepted), or goods/services (1 RHEO settlement fee).
   - Multi-hop trades (via trusted contacts) cost +0.1 RHEO per hop.

## Pricing and Fees
- **Local Fiat Pricing**: All items are priced per unit in local fiat currency (e.g., $2 CAD per lb for tomatoes).
- **Settlement Options**:
  - **Cash**: Pay the total fiat amount based on quantity (e.g., $4 CAD for 2 lbs).
  - **Mutual Credit**: Earn/spend credits equivalent to the fiat total, recorded as IOUs (e.g., “$4 CAD owed”).
  - **RHEO**: Use as a cash substitute for credit settlements, if agreed (valued at community rates, initially 1 RHEO ≈ $1 CAD in 2026).
- **Fees**:
  - 3% RHEO transaction fee (e.g., 0.12 RHEO on a $4 CAD trade, if RHEO used).
  - Action fees: 0.25 RHEO (listing), 0.5 RHEO (claiming), 1 RHEO (credit settlement).
- **No Tokens Needed**: Earn RHEO through trades or airdrops (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).

## Example Trade
- **Bob Lists**: Tomatoes at $2 CAD per lb, 5 lbs available, contacts-only.
- **Peter (Bob’s Contact)**: Sees Bob’s tomatoes and requests 1 lb ($2 CAD).
- **Paul and Sara (Peter’s Contacts)**: See tomatoes as if from Peter at $2.50 CAD per lb, each request 1 lb ($2.50 CAD each).
- **Trade Completes**:
  - Peter collects 3 lbs from Bob ($6 CAD total, mutual credit).
  - Peter delivers 1 lb to Paul and 1 lb to Sara, earning $5 CAD credit ($2.50 each).
  - Bob pays 0.18 RHEO (3% fee on $6) if RHEO used; Peter pays 0.15 RHEO (3% on $5) if RHEO used.
- **Outcome**: Bob gets credit, Peter earns a markup, Paul and Sara get tomatoes.
