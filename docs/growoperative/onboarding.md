# Growoperative Onboarding Guide

**Growoperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowering communities to trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes, herbs) using flexible settlement options. This guide helps gardeners, neighbors, and resilience enthusiasts join the platform, list goods, and trade, fostering sustainable food systems and local resilience. Instructional explainer videos will accompany this guide to simplify the process, launching alongside the May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay, BC, and other interested communities worldwide.

## Why Join?
- **Expand Your Garden**: Grow more knowing your surplus has a reliable market, reducing waste and boosting local food production.
- **Reduce Food Waste**: Share excess produce, addressing the $1,600/year household waste problem (Pitch Deck Page 6).
- **Build Community**: Trade with neighbors, strengthening local ties via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook resilience groups.
- **Flexible Trading**: Settle trades with cash, mutual credit, or RHEO, suiting your preference.
- **Sustain the System**: A 3% RHEO transaction fee supports maintainers, eliminating volunteer burnout.

## Getting Started
1. **Access the App**:
   - Use the Progressive Web App (PWA) at launch (May 2026), with native iOS/Android apps to follow.
   - Watch the **explainer video** (available on X and YouTube) for a quick setup overview.
   - No crypto knowledge required; the interface is gardener-friendly.
2. **Create an Account**:
   - Sign up with an email or pseudonymous wallet address.
   - Connect with friends or local resilience groups to build your trust network.
3. **List Your Surplus**:
   - Add items (e.g., “5 lbs tomatoes”) with photos and a price (e.g., 2 RHEO, $2 cash, or 2 credits).
   - Listing fee: 0.25 RHEO (earned later if no tokens yet).
   - See the **instructional video** on listing for tips.
4. **Browse and Trade**:
   - Search for goods (e.g., bread, zucchini).
   - Request a trade, paying a 0.5 RHEO claiming fee.
   - Settle with cash, mutual credit, or RHEO (3% RHEO fee applies).
   - Watch the **trading video** for a step-by-step guide.
5. **Settle Credits**:
   - Mutual credit allows IOUs, settled later (1 RHEO settlement fee).
   - Multi-hop trades (via trusted friends) cost +0.1 RHEO per hop.

## Pricing and Fees
- **Flexible Pricing**: Set prices in cash, RHEO, or credits, agreed with trading partners.
- **RHEO Guidance**: Initially 1 RHEO ≈ $1 (2026), transitioning to community-driven values.
- **Fees**:
  - 3% RHEO transaction fee (e.g., 0.06 RHEO on a 2 RHEO trade).
  - Action fees: 0.25 RHEO (listing), 0.5 RHEO (claiming), 1 RHEO (credit settlement).
- **No Tokens Needed**: Earn RHEO through trades or airdrops (see [airdrops](../../community/airdrops.md)).

## Example Trade
- **You List**: 5 lbs tomatoes for 2 RHEO, $2 cash, or 2 credits.
- **Neighbor Requests**: Pays 0.5 RHEO claiming fee and chooses cash.
- **Trade Completes**: You pay 0.06 RHEO (3% fee) if using RHEO, or none if cash; receive $2 or equivalent.
