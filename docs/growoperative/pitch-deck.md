# Growoperative Pitch Deck Summary

**Growoperative** is the flagship application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) fostering community resilience through mutual credit trading. Starting with gardening surplus, Growoperative empowers local communities to trade without fiat reliance, paving the way for the broader **FOAF marketplace**. This summary highlights key points from the pitch deck, updated to reflect flexible trade settlement options and the projectâ€™s roadmap, correcting the outdated 10% FOAF fee (Pitch Deck Page 7) to the current 3% RHEO fee.

## Problem (Pages 2-3)
- **Fiat Dependence**: Cash scarcity limits trade, leaving surplus garden produce wasted.
- **Untapped Gardening Potential**: Many gardeners grow less than they could because they lack a reliable outlet for surplus, fearing waste.
- **Food Waste**: 35% of U.S. households garden, yet much of their surplus rots (Pitch Deck Page 2).
- **Volunteer Burnout**: Traditional Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) collapse due to uncompensated maintainers.
- **Supply Chain Fragility**: Recent disruptions highlight the need for resilient local economies.

## Solution (Pages 3-5)
- **Peer-to-Peer App**: A user-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and React.js, enabling users to list, request, and trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes for bread).
- **Flexible Trade Settlement**:
  - **Cash**: For users preferring traditional currency.
  - **Mutual Credit**: An encouraged option to earn and spend credits, fostering community resilience.
  - **RHEO**: The depegged utility token for seamless, community-priced transactions.
- **Fee Structure**: 3% RHEO transaction fee, plus action fees (e.g., 0.25 RHEO for listing), funds node operators (50%), treasury (30%), and burning (20%).
- **Inclusive Access**: No tokens required; RHEO flows through trusted networks.

## Market Opportunity (Page 6)
- **Gardening Boom**: 18.3M new gardeners in the U.S. since 2020, with potential to expand gardens if surplus has a market.
- **Multi-Location Launch**: Initial alpha testing in Crawford Bay, BC, with plans to launch in multiple locations worldwide by May 2026, wherever interested communities (e.g., Kaslo, Nelson, Winlaw, or global resilience groups) join via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook.
- **Global Potential**: Scalable to resilience communities everywhere (e.g., Kootenays, Asheville).

## Business Model (Pages 7-8)
- **Revenue**: 3% RHEO fee on all trades, depegged from fiat, ensures sustainability.
- **Token System**:
  - **FOAF**: 25M fixed supply for governance and staking.
  - **RHEO**: Utility token for transactions and fees.
- **Airdrops**: 8M FOAF (32% of supply) to bootstrap adoption among gardeners and resilience groups across multiple locations.

## Roadmap (Page 12)
- **Current**: PWA supports listing, requesting, matching, and fulfilling trades.
- **Q4 2025**: Add payment and mutual credit tracking to PWA.
- **Q2 2026**: Launch native iOS/Android apps for May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay and other interested communities.
- **Q4 2026**: Expand to additional regions and refine based on feedback.
- **2027**: Scale to global resilience networks, transition to dApp.

## Funding (Page 13)
