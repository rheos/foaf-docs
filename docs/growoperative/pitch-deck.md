# GrowOperative Pitch Deck Summary

**GrowOperative** is the flagship application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) fostering community resilience through mutual credit and trust-based trade. Starting with gardening surplus, GrowOperative empowers local communities to exchange goods without cash reliance — laying the foundation for the broader **FOAF marketplace**. This summary reflects the updated system architecture, replacing the outdated 10% FOAF fee (Pitch Deck Page 7) with a fairer RHEO-based model and clarifying the phased roadmap to native app deployment and DAO control.

## Problem (Pages 2–3)
- **Fiat Dependence**: Cash scarcity limits trade, leaving surplus garden produce wasted.
- **Untapped Gardening Potential**: Gardeners grow less when they lack a reliable outlet for excess.
- **Food Waste**: Up to 40% of food is wasted; gardeners contribute simply because they can’t redistribute.
- **Volunteer Burnout**: LETS and community exchange systems collapse without sustainable rewards.
- **Supply Chain Fragility**: Global disruptions highlight the need for local resilience.

---

## Solution (Pages 3–5)
- **Peer-to-Peer Web App**: A user-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and React.js lets users list what they have (produce, seedlings, etc.) for community redistribution.
- **Flexible Settlement Options**:
  - **Cash** – eTransfer, PayPal, Venmo, or in-person
  - **Mutual Credit** – ledger-tracked IOUs in local fiat value
  - **RHEO** – the required utility token for system fees and optional settlement, routed via trust chains
- **Fee Model**:
  - **3% of trade value** in RHEO
  - **3% of markup** on intermediary resales
  - **1% per-hop premium** for RHEO routing through trust networks
  - Fees are **paid by those who profit**, not the buyer
- **No Token Barrier**: Users don’t need to hold RHEO; it flows through trust paths from FOAF stakers. Obligations are tracked transparently.

## Market Opportunity (Page 6)
- **Gardening Boom**: 18.3M new gardeners in the U.S. since 2020
- **Initial Focus**: Crawford Bay, BC for May 2026 alpha launch; expansion to other resilience-minded communities (e.g., Kaslo, Nelson, Asheville)
- **Global Potential**: Scales anywhere people grow food and want to share it — via Signal, Telegram, and grassroots networks

---

## Business Model (Pages 7–8)
- **Revenue**:
  - RHEO-based transaction and routing fees sustain the network
  - No flat listing or action fees at launch
- **Token System**:
  - **FOAF** – 25M fixed supply for governance and RHEO generation
  - **RHEO** – dynamic utility token for all system fees and optional value transfer
- **Trust-Chain Logic**: RHEO flows from FOAF holders to users via contact chains, creating decentralized, peer-based microcredit relationships

---

## Roadmap (Page 12)
- **Current (2025)**: PWA supports listing, matching, and off-platform settlement
- **Q4 2025**: Add credit tracking, RHEO routing, and smart contract infrastructure
- **Q2–Q3 2026**: Launch native iOS/Android apps with explainer videos for alpha in Crawford Bay and other nodes
- **Q4 2026**: Activate DAO governance over fees, emissions, and expansion logic
- **2027**: Scale to global resilience networks via the FOAF marketplace and dApp transition

---
