# Growoperative Pitch Deck Summary

**Growoperative** is the flagship application of the **FOAF Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) fostering community resilience through mutual credit trading. Starting with gardening surplus, Growoperative empowers local communities to trade without fiat reliance, paving the way for the broader **FOAF marketplace**. This summary highlights key points from the pitch deck, updated to reflect flexible trade settlement options and the projectâ€™s roadmap, correcting the outdated 10% FOAF fee (Pitch Deck Page 7) to the current 3% RHEO fee.

## Problem (Pages 2-3)
- **Fiat Dependence**: Cash scarcity limits trade, leaving surplus garden produce wasted.
- **Untapped Gardening Potential**: Many gardeners grow less than they could because they lack a reliable outlet for surplus, fearing waste.
- **Food Waste**: 35% of U.S. households garden, yet much of their surplus rots (Pitch Deck Page 2).
- **Volunteer Burnout**: Traditional Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) collapse due to uncompensated maintainers.
- **Supply Chain Fragility**: Recent disruptions highlight the need for resilient local economies.

## Solution (Pages 3-5)
- **Peer-to-Peer App**: A user-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and React.js, enabling users to list, request, and trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes for bread).
- **Flexible Trade Settlement**:
  - **Cash**: For users preferring traditional currency.
  - **Mutual Credit**: An encouraged option to earn and spend credits, fostering community resilience.
  - **RHEO**: The depegged utility token for seamless, community-priced transactions.
- **Fee Structure**: 3% RHEO transaction fee, plus action fees (e.g., 0.25 RHEO for listing), funds node operators (50%), treasury (30%), and burning (20%).
- **Inclusive Access**: No tokens required; RHEO flows through trusted networks.

## Market Opportunity (Page 6)
- **Gardening Boom**: 18.3M new gardeners in the U.S. since 2020, with potential to expand gardens if surplus has a market.
- **Local Focus**: Initial alpha testing in Crawford Bay, BC, with outreach to Kaslo, Nelson, and Winlaw resilience groups via Signal, Telegram, and Facebook.
- **Global Potential**: Scalable to resilience communities worldwide (e.g., Kootenays, Asheville).

## Business Model (Pages 7-8)
- **Revenue**: 3% RHEO fee on all trades, depegged from fiat, ensures sustainability.
- **Token System**:
  - **FOAF**: 25M fixed supply for governance and staking.
  - **RHEO**: Utility token for transactions and fees.
- **Airdrops**: 8M FOAF (32% of supply) to bootstrap adoption among gardeners and resilience groups.

## Roadmap (Page 12)
- **Current**: PWA supports listing, requesting, matching, and fulfilling trades.
- **Q4 2025**: Add payment and mutual credit tracking to PWA.
- **Q2 2026**: Launch native iOS/Android apps for May 2026 alpha in Crawford Bay.
- **Q4 2026**: Expand to Kootenay region and refine based on feedback.
- **2027**: Scale to global resilience networks, transition to dApp.

## Funding (Page 13)
