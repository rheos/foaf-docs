# GrowOperative Pitch

**GrowOperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, introducing mutual credit and decentralized trade to empower local communities — starting with surplus food from backyard gardens.

## 🚧 The Problem: Cash Scarcity & System Fatigue

Local communities are held back by two core problems:

- **Fiat Dependence**: When money is tight, people stop trading — even when they have value to offer.
- **Volunteer Burnout**: Traditional LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) collapse because those maintaining them aren’t compensated.

Result: surplus is wasted, coordination is lost, and community resilience declines.

## 🌱 Our Solution: Mutual Credit on a Decentralized Ledger

**GrowOperative** is a mobile app that makes trading food and services as easy as messaging a friend — powered by trust-based, peer-routed networks and blockchain infrastructure.

### Core Features:
- **Offer & Request Marketplace**  
  Users list what they have (e.g., tomatoes) and what they need (e.g., bread, childcare).

- **Flexible Settlement**  
  Trades can settle in:
  - **Cash (broadly defined)** – including eTransfer, PayPal, Venmo, or in-person. The payer marks the transaction as sent; the receiver confirms receipt in the app.
  - **Mutual Credit** – ledger-tracked IOUs in local currency, settled later via any method agreed by the parties
  - **RHEO** – a utility token used for all system fees and optional trade settlement

  The app facilitates transparency and record-keeping — but users handle payment directly in whatever form works best for them.

- **Smart Fee Model**  
  - **3% of trade value** in RHEO for standard transactions  
  - **3% of markup** (in RHEO) for multi-hop intermediaries — so someone making $100 pays $3, while a $1 markup costs only $0.03  
  - **Small action fees** (e.g., 0.25 RHEO to list)

  Fees are **proportional to value created**, making the system fair, scalable, and microtransaction-friendly.

## 🔗 Token System

### FOAF Token
- Fixed 25M supply  
- Used for governance, staking, and long-term alignment  
- FOAF holders stake to generate RHEO and vote on system parameters

### RHEO Token
- Required utility token for all platform fees and trade settlement  
- Dynamic, non-pegged supply; for illustration, early onboarding assumes ~1 RHEO ≈ $1 CAD  
- Flows through the network automatically via trust connections

> Users don’t need to hold RHEO directly. When a trade or action requires RHEO, it is passed through the social trust chain — ultimately originating from a FOAF holder. Those FOAF stakers generate RHEO and extend it across their contact networks, creating transparent credit relationships. As long as someone in your extended network holds FOAF, you can fully participate.

This architecture keeps the experience simple for non-technical users while maintaining decentralized integrity and fair compensation for contributors.

## 🌟 Why It Matters

GrowOperative isn’t just an app — it’s a **blueprint for post-fiat community infrastructure**:

- **Fiat-optional local trade**, powered by trust and transparent networks  
- **Decentralized, user-aligned value routing**, without centralized gatekeepers  
- **Sustainable economics**, with rewards tied to real value creation

It starts in the garden — but it scales to every corner of resilient community life.  
**A system where value stays local and grows outward.**
