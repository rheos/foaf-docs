# GrowOperative Pitch

**GrowOperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, introducing mutual credit and decentralized trade to empower local communities — starting with surplus food from backyard gardens.

---

## 🚧 The Problem: Cash Scarcity & System Fatigue

Local communities everywhere are constrained by two core problems:

- **Fiat Dependence**: When money is tight, people stop trading — even when they have abundance to share.
- **Volunteer Burnout**: Traditional LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) collapse because those running them are unpaid and overwhelmed.

Result: surplus rots, neighbors stay disconnected, and resilience erodes.

## 🌱 Our Solution: Mutual Credit on a Decentralized Ledger

**GrowOperative** is a mobile app that makes trading food and services as easy as messaging a friend — all backed by transparent, trust-based infrastructure.

- **Offer & Request Marketplace**  
  List what you have (tomatoes, tools, time) and request what you need (childcare, bread, repairs).

- **Flexible Settlement Options**  
  Trade can be settled via:
  - **Cash** – when preferred
  - **Mutual Credit** – ledger-based IOUs between trusted peers
  - **RHEO** – the app’s utility token, used for transaction fees and optional trade settlement

- **Sustainable Fee Model**  
  - 3% RHEO fee on trades  
  - Small action fees (e.g., 0.25 RHEO to list)  
  Fee distribution:
    • 50% → Node Operators  
    • 30% → Treasury  
    • 20% → Burned (deflationary)

- **Token Architecture**
  - **FOAF Token**: Governance and staking token (fixed 25M supply)  
  - **RHEO Token**: Utility token used for settlement and network participation

- **No Barrier to Entry**  
  Users don’t need to purchase tokens to start — RHEO can be earned or moved through trusted contact chains, ensuring broad accessibility.

## 🌍 Market Opportunity

- **Gardening First**: 35% of U.S. households already grow food. Much of it goes unused.
- **Global Potential**: Resilience-minded communities (like the Kootenays or Asheville) are ready but lack modern tools.
- **Expandable Model**: Just like Amazon started with books, we begin with gardens. The same system can scale to tools, repairs, child care, and beyond.

## 🌟 Why It Matters

GrowOperative is a prototype for a new kind of economy:

- **Fiat-optional trade**, powered by trust and transparency
- **Decentralized infrastructure** that serves real needs
- **Sustainable system design** that rewards participation and scales naturally

It starts in the garden — but it grows into something much bigger:  
**a people-powered economy for a post-fiat world.**
