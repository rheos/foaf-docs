# Growoperative Pitch

**Growoperative** is the first application of the **FOAF Foundation**, introducing mutual credit trading to empower local communities, starting with gardening surplus. This pitch outlines the problem, solution, market, team, and funding needs, paving the way for the broader **FOAF marketplace**.

## The Problem: Fiat Dependence and Burnout
Local communities face **economic resilience** challenges:
- **Fiat Dependence**: Cash scarcity limits trade, leaving surplus resources (e.g., garden produce) wasted.
- **Volunteer Burnout**: Traditional Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) fail due to uncompensated maintainers.

## The Solution: Mutual Credit with a Crypto Backbone
Growoperative revolutionizes local trade with:
- **Marketplace App**: Users list offers (e.g., tomatoes) and requests (e.g., bread) in a user-friendly app, starting with gardening.
- **Mutual Credit**: Users “owe” credits, settled later with goods, services, or cash.
- **Crypto Integration**:
  - **FOAF**: Governance and staking token (25M fixed supply).
  - **RHEO**: Depegged transaction token, priced natively (e.g., 2 RHEO for tomatoes).
  - **3% transaction fee** in RHEO, plus action fees (e.g., 0.25 RHEO for listing), funds node operators (50%), treasury (30%), and burning (20%).
- **Inclusive Access**: No tokens required; RHEO flows through trusted networks.

## Market Opportunity
- **Gardening Niche**: 35% of U.S. households garden (Pitch Deck Page 2), with surplus often wasted.
- **Global Potential**: Resilience communities (e.g., Kootenays, Asheville) need modern trade tools.
- **Scalability**: From gardening to the FOAF marketplace for furniture, tools, and services.

## The Team
- **Project Manager**: Steers the vision for community empowerment.
- **Marketing Specialist**: Drives adoption through grassroots outreach.
- **Lead Programmer**: Builds the app and token system.
- **Junior Programmer**: Supports coding and testing.
- **Graphic Designer**: Crafts an intuitive interface.

## The Ask
Seeking **$300K** (Pitch Deck Page 13) to:
- Develop the Growoperative app and integrate RHEO fees.
- Market to gardening communities.
- Launch operations and transition to a dApp (Q4 2023).

## Why It Matters
Growoperative is a movement to:
- **Save Cash**: Trade without fiat.
- **Build Resilience**: Strengthen local ties.
- **End Burnout**: Sustain maintainers with RHEO fees.
It starts with gardening and scales to the FOAF marketplace, creating unstoppable local economies.
