## What I’m Looking For

I’m looking for a fundraising connector or marketing partner who understands the startup and crypto landscape and is willing to work on a performance-based model. This person or team should be capable of making high-quality introductions to angel investors, VCs, and ecosystem funds that are a fit for the GrowOperative project and the FOAF protocol. Ideally, they also understand how to position a decentralized, mission-driven project to appeal to values-aligned funders.

### Core Qualities:

* Proven track record of raising funds for early-stage startups (especially in crypto or Web3)
* Strong, active network of investors (not just theoretical or cold contacts)
* Willingness to work on a success-based compensation structure (e.g. a percentage of funds raised)
* Strategic input on pitch refinement and investor targeting
* Familiarity with values-driven, sustainability, or regenerative economy projects is a major plus

### Compensation Structure:

I am open to the following structures:

* **Success Fee**: Typically 5% to 10% of total funds raised, depending on the scale and involvement.

  * For smaller raises (\$25k–\$100k), 10% is reasonable
  * For larger raises (\$250k+), 5% is more typical
* **Equity Compensation**: Available for those contributing significant strategic value or ongoing involvement
* **Hybrid**: A modest monthly retainer paired with a reduced success fee (e.g. 2%–5%), only if there's measurable progress and warm leads delivered

## Strategy to Find the Right Partner

### 1. **Leverage My Existing Network**

* Reach out to previous contacts in crypto conferences, events, and Telegram/Discord communities
* Ask trusted peers if they know anyone who specializes in early-stage fundraising for Web3 projects

### 2. **Target Crypto-Specific Communities and Platforms**

* Post in targeted groups like:

  * DAO Coordination communities
  * Crypto Twitter threads focused on project funding
  * Discord servers related to Web3 acceleration and launchpads
  * Reddit communities like r/cryptostartups and r/web3

### 3. **Search for Proven Fundraisers on Professional Platforms**

* Use LinkedIn and AngelList (Wellfound) to identify individuals who list fundraising or startup growth as a specialty
* Look for profiles that mention actual capital raised, not vague marketing fluff
* Message with a direct and clear value proposition, emphasizing shared upside

### 4. **Use Selective Freelance Platforms**

* Explore Toptal or specialized Web3 talent platforms like Braintrust, CryptoJobsList, or WorkOnChain
* Prioritize those with verified histories, testimonials, and prior involvement in capital raises

### 5. **Attend Events and Pitch Forums**

* Join demo days, virtual investor matching sessions, and Web3-focused pitch events
* Not necessarily to pitch myself right away — but to meet the connectors who *bring* projects to these events

### 6. **Maintain Clear Boundaries and Agreements**

* Always formalize terms before any payment or exclusive commitment
* Structure agreements that clarify scope, deliverables, timelines, and what constitutes a successful introduction or raise
* Make it clear that without verifiable traction, there is no upfront payment

## Bottom Line

I’m not looking for someone to *talk about* funding.. I’m looking for someone who can pick up the phone or drop a message and get real conversations started with aligned investors. They don’t need to believe in the entire crypto space, but they *do* need to believe in this project enough to take some shared risk.
