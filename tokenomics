**FOAF/RHEO Tokenomics Whitepaper**

---

**Project Vision**

This project is designed to build local community resilience through a decentralized exchange system that minimizes reliance on fiat currency. By enabling peer-to-peer trade of goods and services—starting with gardening surplus and scaling to include all community-driven commerce—the system empowers individuals to create and exchange value within trusted networks.

The system uses two tokens: **FOAF**, the core stake and trust token, and **RHEO**, the dynamic utility token used for transaction execution.

**FOAF** stands for **Friend of a Friend**, reflecting its role in building trust through social connection.
**RHEO** means **flow**, emphasizing its use in powering value exchange and system operations.

**Token Overview**

| Token               | Symbol | Type          | Supply               | Divisibility | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friends-of-a-Friend | FOAF   | Main token    | 25,000,000 (fixed)   | Indivisible  | Governance, staking, trust, gas generation              |
| RHEO                | RHEO   | Utility token | Dynamic/inflationary | Divisible    | Transaction fees, IOU settlements, marketplace activity |

**Token Roles and Flow**

**FOAF (Main Token)**

* Fixed supply of 25,000,000 units
* Indivisible: each token represents a whole share of network trust
* Generates RHEO when staked
* Staking is required to earn RHEO, and larger or longer-term stakes may yield proportionally more
* Used in governance and to secure the network

**RHEO (Utility Token)**

* Used for all platform transactions, listings, claims, and settlements
* Emitted to FOAF stakers based on stake amount
* May be burned or recycled on use
* Distributed partially to node operators, treasury, and protocol functions

**FOAF Allocation Model**

| Category                        | Allocation | %   | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | --- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Community Incentives & Airdrops | 8,000,000  | 32% | Grow user base and early adoption        |
| Ecosystem Development Fund      | 6,000,000  | 24% | Partner integrations, dev support        |
| Node/Validator Reward Pool      | 5,000,000  | 20% | Reward network maintenance and uptime    |
| Founders & Core Team            | 4,000,000  | 16% | Long-term aligned project leadership     |
| Advisors & Strategic Backers    | 1,500,000  | 6%  | Early ecosystem support and guidance     |
| Treasury Reserve                | 500,000    | 2%  | Emergency or DAO-governed future funding |

**Node Operator Incentives**

Node operators (community validators or coordinators) play a key role in:

* Verifying credit relationships and trust paths
* Relaying transactions
* Facilitating marketplace coordination

They are rewarded with:

* A portion of RHEO gas fees from transactions they relay
* Scheduled FOAF distributions from the node pool
* Optional FOAF staking to increase visibility and earnings

**RHEO Usage Framework**

| Action                                                 | RHEO Cost         | Notes                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| List an item/service                                   | 0.25 RHEO         | Discourages spam listings      |
| Claim a listing                                        | 0.5 RHEO          | Paid by requester              |
| Settle deferred IOU                                    | 1 RHEO            | Finalize credit-based exchange |
| Multi-hop trust path                                   | +0.1 RHEO per hop | Rewards relay participation    |
| Coordination task (batch delivery, route optimization) | Variable          | Optional market-priced fee     |

---

**RHEO Emission Model**

* Only **staked FOAF** generates RHEO
* Base emission rate: **0.1 RHEO per staked FOAF per 30 days**
* Total emissions are proportional to staked supply, allowing control over inflation
* Bonus RHEO emissions may be awarded for active participation or verified marketplace contributions
* No time-based tiers, minimizing incentive for wallet splitting or gaming

---

**Governance (DAO Phase)**

FOAF holders will participate in governance over:

* RHEO emission rates and parameters
* Treasury disbursement
* Marketplace rules
* Node qualification criteria

**Vesting Schedule**

| Group              | Lock Period          | Vesting Period                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Founders           | 12 months            | 36 months linear vesting                |
| Advisors           | 6 months             | 18 months linear vesting                |
| Node Rewards       | Released on schedule | Multi-year, protocol-controlled release |
| Community Airdrops | Some immediate       | Some milestone-based unlocks            |

---

**Ideological Integrity and Utility**

* FOAF remains indivisible and capped, symbolizing trust and long-term alignment
* RHEO reflects ongoing activity and real-world use, not speculation
* Credit-based systems reduce fiat dependence, while crypto-backed mechanics provide trust and reward for those maintaining the system
* FOAF is not required to use the app—users can receive tokens indirectly via their social network, emphasizing inclusion

This token model aligns economic sustainability with community empowerment and long-term resilience.
