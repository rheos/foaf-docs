# FOAF Foundation Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for the **FOAF (Friend of a Friend) Foundation**, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) dedicated to fostering community resilience and promoting independence from fiat currency systems. Our mission is to empower communities through decentralized, people-powered solutions, starting with innovative projects like the **Growoperative app**.

## What is the FOAF Foundation?
The FOAF Foundation is a DAO focused on building sustainable, equitable systems that enable communities to thrive outside traditional financial frameworks. By leveraging mutual credit systems and decentralized governance, we aim to create tools that strengthen local networks and reduce reliance on centralized institutions.

## Our Mission
- **Enhance Community Resilience**: Develop tools that empower local networks.
- **Promote Fiat Independence**: Create alternative economic models like mutual credit.
- **Foster Decentralized Governance**: Ensure transparent, community-driven decision-making.

## First Project: Growoperative
Our inaugural project, the **Growoperative app**, is a pioneering initiative to bootstrap a mutual credit system, starting with garden sharing as a niche. It serves as the first step toward a broader vision of people-powered money. For more details, explore the [Growoperative documentation](./docs/growoperative/).
