# FOAF Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for the **FOAF Foundation**, a decentralized platform empowering communities to trade goods and services without fiat currency reliance. The **Growoperative app** is our first application, introducing mutual credit trading for gardening surplus, with plans to expand into a broader **FOAF marketplace** for diverse goods and services. Built on a dual-token system (**FOAF** for governance, **RHEO** for transactions), FOAF fosters local resilience, reduces waste, and creates sustainable economies.

This repository contains all project documentation, including pitches, tokenomics, technical plans, and governance strategies. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.

## Mission
The FOAF Foundation enables peer-to-peer trade within trusted networks, using a crypto-powered system to:
- Reduce fiat dependence through mutual credit and RHEO, the native denomination.
- Eliminate volunteer burnout with a 3% transaction fee and RHEO rewards for maintainers.
- Start with gardening via Growoperative and scale to a comprehensive FOAF marketplace.

## Key Features
- **Growoperative App**: Trade gardening surplus (e.g., tomatoes) using mutual credit, with a user-friendly interface.
- **FOAF Marketplace (Future)**: Expand to trade diverse goods/services (e.g., tools, childcare).
- **Dual-Token System**:
  - **FOAF**: Fixed supply (25M), indivisible token for staking and governance.
  - **RHEO**: Depegged utility token for fees and transactions, evolving into the platform’s currency.
- **3% Transaction Fee**: Paid in RHEO, supporting node operators (50%), treasury (30%), and burning (20%) for sustainability.
- **Inclusive Access**: No tokens required to start; RHEO flows through trusted networks.
- **DAO Governance**: Transitioning to community control by Q4 2023–2024.

## Documentation
Documentation is organized into key areas (coming soon):
- **Pitch**: Project overview, problem, solution, and team.
- **Tokenomics**: FOAF/RHEO roles, allocation, and fee structure.
- **Technical**: MVP, dApp architecture, and roadmap.
- **Governance**: DAO transition and community governance plans.
- **Community**: User onboarding and airdrop incentives.

## Getting Involved
- **Users**: Join Growoperative to trade gardening surplus, no crypto knowledge needed.
- **Contributors**: Submit pull requests for docs or code (coming soon).
- **Node Operators**: Run a node to earn RHEO and FOAF rewards.
