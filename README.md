# FOAF Foundation Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **FOAF (Friend of a Friend) Foundation** — a decentralized initiative to strengthen local communities through resilient, trust-based systems. Our first project, **GrowOperative**, turns surplus garden produce into local economic power using mutual credit and blockchain technology.

## 🌱 Our Purpose

The FOAF Foundation is a community-led DAO building practical tools for food sovereignty, mutual aid, and post-fiat resilience. We believe that **small-scale action and decentralized technology** can empower neighborhoods to become self-sustaining — starting in the garden.

## 🎯 Our Mission

- **Grow Local Resilience**: Build tools for communities to share, trade, and thrive together.
- **Reduce Fiat Dependence**: Enable peer-to-peer credit systems that work without banks or cash.
- **Decentralize Governance**: Support transparent, community-driven control of vital systems.

## 🚀 Our First Project: GrowOperative

**GrowOperative** is a mobile and web app for trading surplus food, labor, and services through your personal network. Built around gardening as an accessible entry point, it evolves into a **mutual credit supply chain** — a true “friend-of-a-friend” economy.
