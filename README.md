Growoperative Documentation
Welcome to the documentation repository for Growoperative, a decentralized exchange system empowering local communities to trade goods and services—starting with gardening surplus—without reliance on fiat currency. Built on a dual-token model (FOAF for governance, RHEO for transactions), Growoperative fosters resilience, reduces food waste, and creates sustainable local economies.
This repository contains all project documentation, including the pitch, tokenomics, technical roadmap, and governance plans. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
Mission
Growoperative enables peer-to-peer trade within trusted networks, using a crypto-powered platform to:

Reduce fiat dependence through a credit-based system and RHEO, the native denomination.
Eliminate volunteer burnout by compensating maintainers with a 3% transaction fee and RHEO rewards.
Start with gardening (e.g., surplus produce) and scale to broader community commerce.

Key Features

Marketplace App: List and trade goods/services (e.g., tomatoes, childcare) with a user-friendly interface.
Dual-Token System:
FOAF: Fixed supply (25M), indivisible token for staking and governance.
RHEO: Depegged utility token for fees and transactions, evolving into the platform’s currency.


3% Transaction Fee: Paid in RHEO, supporting node operators (50%), treasury (30%), and burning (20%) for sustainability.
Inclusive Access: No tokens required to start; RHEO flows through trusted networks.
DAO Governance: Transitioning to community control by Q4 2023–2024.
