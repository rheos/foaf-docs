RHEO Usage Framework
Transaction Fee Structure
To support network operations and sustainability, a 3% transaction fee is applied to the value of all trades, payable in RHEO, the platform’s native utility token. This fee is calculated based on the transaction’s value as expressed in RHEO, determined by user-agreed pricing, community-driven price feeds, or decentralized oracles. The fee ensures affordability while funding node operators, the treasury, and RHEO supply management.

Fee Breakdown

3% Transaction Fee:
Applied to the RHEO value of the trade (e.g., a 2 RHEO trade incurs a 0.06 RHEO fee).
Distributed as follows:
50% to Node Operators: Rewards validators and coordinators for transaction relaying and network maintenance.
30% to Treasury: Funds ecosystem development, DAO initiatives, and emergency reserves.
20% Burned/Recycled: Reduces RHEO supply to control inflation and support RHEO’s value as an independent denomination.


Collected via a transparent smart contract, ensuring decentralized fee management.



Action-Specific Fees
In addition to the transaction fee, specific actions incur fixed RHEO costs to discourage spam and reward participation:

Listing an item/service: 0.25 RHEO.
Claiming a listing: 0.5 RHEO (paid by requester).
Settling a deferred IOU: 1 RHEO (finalizes credit-based exchange).
Multi-hop trust path: +0.1 RHEO per hop (rewards relay nodes).
Coordination tasks (e.g., batch delivery): Variable, market-priced (optional).

RHEO as an Independent Denomination
RHEO is designed to depeg from fiat currencies (e.g., USD) and function as the platform’s native denomination. Initially, RHEO may be loosely pegged to fiat for onboarding (e.g., 1 RHEO ≈ $1), but its value will transition to market-driven dynamics based on:

Transaction volume and RHEO demand.
RHEO emissions from FOAF staking (0.1 RHEO per FOAF per 30 days).
Burning of 20% of transaction fees.Users price goods and services directly in RHEO (e.g., 10 tomatoes = 2 RHEO), fostering a fiat-independent economy. The DAO may adjust fee parameters to manage volatility, ensuring fairness and stability.

Mitigating Volatility
To address RHEO’s price fluctuations during the depegging process:

Stable Pricing Option: Users may peg prices to stable assets (e.g., USDC) for a transition period, with fees paid in RHEO.
Fee Cap: The 3% fee is capped at 1 RHEO per transaction to protect users if RHEO’s value spikes.
Community Governance: FOAF holders vote on fee adjustments via the DAO, ensuring responsiveness to market conditions.

This fee structure supports the platform’s mission to empower local communities, reduce fiat dependence, and maintain a sustainable, decentralized network.
